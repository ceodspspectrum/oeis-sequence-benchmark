Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Powers of 5: a(n) = 5^n.
Comments: Same as Pisot sequences E(1, 5), L(1, 5), P(1, 5), T(1, 5). Essentially same as Pisot sequences E(5, 25), L(5, 25), P(5, 25), T(5, 25). See A008776 for definitions of Pisot sequences.

a(n) has leading digit 1 if and only if n = A067497 - 1. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Jul 09 2002

With interpolated zeros 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 25, ... (g.f.: x/(1 - 5*x^2)) second inverse binomial transform of Fibonacci(3n)/Fibonacci(3) (A001076). Binomial transform is A085449. - _Paul Barry_, Mar 14 2004

Sums of rows of the triangles in A013620 and A038220. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 14 2006

Sum of coefficients of expansion of (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4)^n. a(n) is number of compositions of natural numbers into n parts less than 5. a(2) = 25 there are 25 compositions of natural numbers into 2 parts less than 5. - _Adi Dani_, Jun 22 2011

The compositions of n in which each natural number is colored by one of p different colors are called p-colored compositions of n. For n >= 1, a(n) equals the number of 5-colored compositions of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color. - _Milan Janjic_, Nov 17 2011

Numbers n such that sigma(5n) = 5n + sigma(n). In fact we have this theorem: p is a prime if and only if all solutions of the equation sigma(p*x) = p*x + sigma(x) are powers of p. - _Jahangeer Kholdi_, Nov 23 2013

From _Doug Bell_, Jun 22 2015: (Start)

Empirical observation: Where n is an odd multiple of 3, let x = (a(n) + 1)/9 and let y be the decimal expansion of x/a(n); then y*(x+1)/x + 1 = y rotated to the left.

Example:

  a(3) = 125;

  x = (125 + 1)/9 = 14;

  y = 112, which is the decimal expansion of 14/125 = 0.112;

  112*(14 + 1)/14 + 1 = 121 = 112 rotated to the left.

(End)

a(n) is the number of n-digit integers that contain only odd digits (A014261). - _Bernard Schott_, Nov 12 2022

Number of pyramids in the Sierpinski fractal square-based pyramid at the n-th step, while A279511 gives the corresponding number of vertices (see IREM link with drawings). - _Bernard Schott_, Nov 29 2022
