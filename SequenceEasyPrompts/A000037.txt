Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Numbers that are not squares (or, the nonsquares).
Comments: Note the remarkable formula for the n-th term (see the FORMULA section)!

These are the natural numbers with an even number of divisors. The number of divisors is odd for the complementary sequence, the squares (sequence A000290) and the numbers for which the number of divisors is divisible by 3 is sequence A059269. - Ola Veshta (olaveshta(AT)my-deja.com), Apr 04 2001

a(n) is the largest integer m not equal to n such that n = (floor(n^2/m) + m)/2. - _Alexander R. Povolotsky_, Feb 10 2008

Union of A007969 and A007970; A007968(a(n)) > 0. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jun 18 2011

Terms of even numbered rows in the triangle A199332. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Nov 23 2011

If a(n) and a(n+1) are of the same parity then (a(n)+a(n+1))/2 is a square. - _Zak Seidov_, Aug 13 2012

Theaetetus of Athens proved the irrationality of the square roots of these numbers in the 4th century BC. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 18 2013

4*a(n) are the even members of A079896, the discriminants of indefinite binary quadratic forms. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 14 2013
