Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: The Franel number a(n) = Sum_{k = 0..n} binomial(n,k)^3.
Comments: Cusick gives a general method of deriving recurrences for the r-th order Franel numbers (this is the sequence of third-order Franel numbers), with floor((r+3)/2) terms.

This is the Taylor expansion of a special point on a curve described by Beauville. - _Matthijs Coster_, Apr 28 2004

An identity of V. Strehl states that a(n) = Sum_{k = 0..n} C(n,k)^2 * binomial(2*k,n). Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that for every n = 2,3,... the polynomial f_n(x) = Sum_{k = 0..n} binomial(n,k)^2 * binomial(2*k,n) * x^(n-k) is irreducible over the field of rational numbers. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Mar 21 2013

Conjecture: a(n) == 2 (mod n^3) iff n is prime. - _Gary Detlefs_, Mar 22 2013

a(p) == 2 (mod p^3) for any prime p since p | C(p,k) for all k = 1,...,p-1. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Aug 14 2013

a(n) is the maximal number of totally mixed Nash equilibria in games of 3 players, each with n+1 pure options. - _Raimundas Vidunas_, Jan 22 2014

This is one of the Apéry-like sequences - see Cross-references. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Aug 06 2017

Diagonal of rational functions 1/(1 - x*y - y*z - x*z - 2*x*y*z), 1/(1 - x - y - z + 4*x*y*z), 1/(1 + y + z + x*y + y*z + x*z + 2*x*y*z), 1/(1 + x + y + z + 2*(x*y + y*z + x*z) + 4*x*y*z). - _Gheorghe Coserea_, Jul 04 2018

a(n) is the constant term in the expansion of ((1 + x) * (1 + y) + (1 + 1/x) * (1 + 1/y))^n. - _Seiichi Manyama_, Oct 27 2019

Diagonal of rational function 1 / ((1-x)*(1-y)*(1-z) - x*y*z). - _Seiichi Manyama_, Jul 11 2020

Named after the Swiss mathematician Jérôme Franel (1859-1939). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 15 2021

It appears that a(n) is equal to the coefficient of (x*y*z)^n in the expansion of (1 + x + y - z)^n * (1 + x - y + z)^n * (1 - x + y + z)^n. Cf. A036917. - _Peter Bala_, Sep 20 2021
