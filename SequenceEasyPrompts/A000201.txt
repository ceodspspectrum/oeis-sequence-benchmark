Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Lower Wythoff sequence (a Beatty sequence): a(n) = floor(n*phi), where phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2 = A001622.
Comments: This is the unique sequence a satisfying a'(n)=a(a(n))+1 for all n in the set N of natural numbers, where a' denotes the ordered complement (in N) of a. - _Clark Kimberling_, Feb 17 2003

This sequence and A001950 may be defined as follows. Consider the maps a -> ab, b -> a, starting from a(1) = a; then A000201 gives the indices of a, A001950 gives the indices of b. The sequence of letters in the infinite word begins a, b, a, a, b, a, b, a, a, b, a, ... Setting a = 0, b = 1 gives A003849 (offset 0); setting a = 1, b = 0 gives A005614 (offset 0). - _Philippe DelÃ©ham_, Feb 20 2004

These are the numbers whose lazy Fibonacci representation (see A095791) includes 1; the complementary sequence (the upper Wythoff sequence, A001950) are the numbers whose lazy Fibonacci representation includes 2 but not 1.

a(n) is the unique monotonic sequence satisfying a(1)=1 and the condition "if n is in the sequence then n+(rank of n) is not in the sequence" (e.g. a(4)=6 so 6+4=10 and 10 is not in the sequence) - _Benoit Cloitre_, Mar 31 2006

Write A for A000201 and B for A001950 (the upper Wythoff sequence, complement of A). Then the composite sequences AA, AB, BA, BB, AAA, AAB,...,BBB,... appear in many complementary equations having solution A000201 (or equivalently, A001950). Typical complementary equations: AB=A+B (=A003623), BB=A+2B (=A101864), BBB=3A+5B (=A134864). - _Clark Kimberling_, Nov 14 2007

Cumulative sum of A001468 terms. - _Eric Angelini_, Aug 19 2008

The lower Wythoff sequence also can be constructed by playing the so-called Mancala-game: n piles of total d(n) chips are standing in a row. The piles are numbered from left to right by 1, 2, 3, ... . The number of chips in a pile at the beginning of the game is equal to the number of the pile. One step of the game is described as follows: Distribute the pile on the very left one by one to the piles right of it. If chips are remaining, build piles out of one chip subsequently to the right. After f(n) steps the game ends in a constant row of piles. The lower Wythoff sequence is also given by n -> f(n). - Roland Schroeder (florola(AT)gmx.de), Jun 19 2010

With the exception of the first term, a(n) gives the number of iterations required to reverse the list {1,2,3,...,n} when using the mapping defined as follows: remove the first term of the list, z(1), and add 1 to each of the next z(1) terms (appending 1's if necessary) to get a new list. See A183110 where this mapping is used and other references given.  This appears to be essentially the Mancala-type game interpretation given by R. Schroeder above. - _John W. Layman_, Feb 03 2011

Also row numbers of A213676 starting with an even number of zeros. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Mar 10 2013

From _Jianing Song_, Aug 18 2022: (Start)

Numbers k such that {k*phi} > phi^(-2), where {} denotes the fractional part.

Proof: Write m = floor(k*phi).

If {k*phi} > phi^(-2), take s = m-k+1. From m < k*phi < m+1 we have k < (m-k+1)*phi < k + phi, so floor(s*phi) = k or k+1. If floor(s*phi) = k+1, then (see A003622) floor((k+1)*phi) = floor(floor(s*phi)*phi) = floor(s*phi^2)-1 = s+floor(s*phi)-1 = m+1, but actually we have (k+1)*phi > m+phi+phi^(-2) = m+2, a contradiction. Hence floor(s*phi) = k.

If floor(s*phi) = k, suppose otherwise that k*phi - m <= phi^(-2), then m < (k+1)*phi <= m+2, so floor((k+1)*phi) = m+1. Suppose that A035513(p,q) = k for p,q >= 1, then A035513(p,q+1) = floor((k+1)*phi) - 1 = m = A035513(s,1). But it is impossible for one number (m) to occur twice in A035513. (End)

The formula from Jianing Song above is a direct consequence of an old result by Carlitz et al. (1972). Their Theorem 11 states that (a(n)) consists of the numbers k such that {k*phi^(-2)}  < phi^(-1). One has {k*phi^(-2)} = {k*(2-phi)} = {-k*phi}. Using that 1-phi^(-1) = phi^(-2), the Jianing Song formula follows. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 14 2023
