Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Numbers that are the sum of 2 nonzero squares.
Comments: From the formula it is easy to see that if k is in this sequence, then so are all odd powers of k. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 13 2009

Also numbers whose cubes are the sum of two nonzero squares. - Joe Namnath and Lawrence Sze

A line perpendicular to y=mx has its first integral y-intercept at a^2+b^2. The remaining ones for that slope are multiples of that primitive value. - _Larry J Zimmermann_, Aug 19 2010

The primes in this sequence are sequence A002313.

Complement of A018825; A025426(a(n)) > 0; A063725(a(n)) > 0. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Aug 16 2011

If the two squares are not equal, then any power is still in the sequence: if k = x^2 + y^2 with x != y, then k^2 = (x^2-y^2)^2 + (2xy)^2 and k^3 = (x(x^2-3y^2))^2 + (y(3x^2-y^2))^2, etc. - _Carmine Suriano_, Jul 13 2012

There are never more than 3 consecutive terms that differ by 1. Triples of consecutive terms that differ by 1 occur infinitely many times, for example, 2(k^2 + k)^2, (k^2 - 1)^2 + (k^2 + 2 k)^2, and (k^2 + k - 1)^2 + (k^2 + k + 1)^2 for any integer k > 1. - _Ivan Neretin_, Mar 16 2017 [Corrected by _Jerzy R Borysowicz_, Apr 14 2017]

Number of terms less than 10^k, k=1,2,3,...: 3, 34, 308, 2690, 23873, 215907, 1984228, ... - _Muniru A Asiru_, Feb 01 2018
