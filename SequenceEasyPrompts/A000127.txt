Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Maximal number of regions obtained by joining n points around a circle by straight lines. Also number of regions in 4-space formed by n-1 hyperplanes.
Comments: a(n) is the sum of the first five terms in the n-th row of Pascal's triangle. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Jan 18 2009

{a(k): 1 <= k <= 5} = divisors of 16. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jun 17 2009

Equals binomial transform of [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...]. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Mar 02 2010

From _Bernard Schott_, Apr 05 2021: (Start)

As a(n) = 2^(n-1) for n = 1..5, it is misleading to believe that a(n) = 2^(n-1) for n > 5 (see Patrick Popescu-Pampu link); other curiosities: a(6) = 2^5 - 1 and a(10) = 2^8.

The sequence of the first differences is A000125, the sequence of the second differences is A000124, the sequence of the third differences is A000027 and the sequence of the fourth differences is the all 1's sequence A000012 (see J. H. Conway and R. K. Guy reference, p. 80). (End)

a(n) is the number of binary words of length n matching the regular expression 0*1*0*1*0*. A000124 and A000125 count binary words of the form 0*1*0* and 1*0*1*0*, respectively. - _Manfred Scheucher_, Jun 22 2023
