Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Two decks each have n kinds of cards, 2 of each kind. The first deck is laid out in order. The second deck is shuffled and laid out next to the first. A match occurs if a card from the second deck is next to a card of the same kind from the first deck. a(n) is the number of ways of achieving no matches.
Comments: Each deck contains 2n cards.

The probability of no matches is a(n)/(2n)!.

n couples meet for a party and they exchange gifts. Each of the 2n writes their name on a piece of paper and puts it into a hat. They take turns drawing names and give their gift to the person whose name they drew. If anyone draws either their own name or the name of their partner, everyone puts the name they have drawn back into the hat and everyone draws anew. a(n) is the number of different permissible drawings. - _Dan Dima_, Dec 17 2006

(2n)! / a(n) is the expected number of deck shuffles until no matches occur. a(n) / (2n)! is the probability for a permissible drawing to be achieved. (2n)! / a(n) is the expected number of drawings before a permissible drawing is achieved. As n goes to infinity (2n)! / a(n) will strictly decrease very slowly to e^2 ~ 7.38906 (starting from n > 2) - _Dan Dima_, Dec 17 2006

a(n) equals the permanent of the (2n)X(2n) matrix with 0's along the main diagonal and the antidiagonal, and 1's everywhere else. - _John M. Campbell_, Jul 11 2011

Also, number of permutations p of (1,...,2n) such that round(p(k)/2) != round(k/2) for all k=1,...,2n (where half-integers are rounded up). - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 30 2015
