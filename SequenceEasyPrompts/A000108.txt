Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Catalan numbers: C(n) = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1) = (2n)!/(n!(n+1)!).
Comments: These were formerly sometimes called Segner numbers.

A very large number of combinatorial interpretations are known - see references, esp. R. P. Stanley, "Catalan Numbers", Cambridge University Press, 2015. This is probably the longest entry in the OEIS, and rightly so.

The solution to Schröder's first problem: number of ways to insert n pairs of parentheses in a word of n+1 letters. E.g., for n=2 there are 2 ways: ((ab)c) or (a(bc)); for n=3 there are 5 ways: ((ab)(cd)), (((ab)c)d), ((a(bc))d), (a((bc)d)), (a(b(cd))).

Consider all the binomial(2n,n) paths on squared paper that (i) start at (0, 0), (ii) end at (2n, 0) and (iii) at each step, either make a (+1,+1) step or a (+1,-1) step. Then the number of such paths that never go below the x-axis (Dyck paths) is C(n). [Chung-Feller]

Number of noncrossing partitions of the n-set. For example, of the 15 set partitions of the 4-set, only [{13},{24}] is crossing, so there are a(4)=14 noncrossing partitions of 4 elements. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jul 11 2011

a(n-1) is the number of ways of expressing an n-cycle (123...n) in the symmetric group S_n as a product of n-1 transpositions (u_1,v_1)*(u_2,v_2)*...*(u_{n-1},v_{n-1}) where u_i<v_i and u_k <= u_j for k < j; see example.  If the condition is dropped, one obtains A000272. - _Joerg Arndt_ and Greg Stevenson, Jul 11 2011

Number of ways of joining 2n points on a circle to form n nonintersecting chords. (If no such restriction imposed, then the number of ways of forming n chords is given by (2n-1)!! = (2n)!/(n!*2^n) = A001147(n).)

M(5) = [0 1 1 2 5 14 26 44 69 94 114 116 94 60 28 8 1], ... - Donald D. Cross (cosinekitty(AT)hotmail.com), Feb 04 2005

The multiplicity with which a prime p divides C_n can be determined by first expressing n+1 in base p. For p=2, the multiplicity is the number of 1 digits minus 1. For p an odd prime, count all digits greater than (p+1)/2; also count digits equal to (p+1)/2 unless final; and count digits equal to (p-1)/2 if not final and the next digit is counted. For example, n=62, n+1 = 223_5, so C_62 is not divisible by 5. n=63, n+1 = 224_5, so 5^3 | C_63. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Feb 08 2006

Koshy and Salmassi give an elementary proof that the only prime Catalan numbers are a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 5. Is the only semiprime Catalan number a(4) = 14? - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Mar 06 2006

The answer is yes. Using the formula C_n = binomial(2n,n)/(n+1), it is immediately clear that C_n can have no prime factor greater than 2n. For n >= 7, C_n > (2n)^2, so it cannot be a semiprime. Given that the Catalan numbers grow exponentially, the above consideration implies that the number of prime divisors of C_n, counted with multiplicity, must grow without limit. The number of distinct prime divisors must also grow without limit, but this is more difficult. Any prime between n+1 and 2n (exclusive) must divide C_n. That the number of such primes grows without limit follows from the prime number theorem. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Apr 14 2006

The number of ways to place n indistinguishable balls in n numbered boxes B1,...,Bn such that at most a total of k balls are placed in boxes B1,...,Bk for k=1,...,n.

Walsh_, Dec 04 2006

C(n) is the degree of the Grassmannian G(1,n+1): the set of lines in (n+1)-dimensional projective space, or the set of planes through the origin in (n+2)-dimensional affine space. The Grassmannian is considered a subset of N-dimensional projective space, N = binomial(n+2,2) - 1. If we choose 2n general (n-1)-planes in projective (n+1)-space, then there are C(n) lines that meet all of them. - Benji Fisher (benji(AT)FisherFam.org), Mar 05 2009

Consider a set of A000217(n) balls of n colors in which, for each integer k = 1 to n, exactly one color appears in the set a total of k times. (Each ball has exactly one color and is indistinguishable from other balls of the same color.) a(n+1) equals the number of ways to choose 0 or more balls of each color while satisfying the following conditions: 1. No two colors are chosen the same positive number of times. 2. For any two colors (c, d) that are chosen at least once, color c is chosen more times than color d iff color c appears more times in the original set than color d.

If the second requirement is lifted, the number of acceptable ways equals A000110(n+1). See related comments for A016098, A085082. (End)

One class of generalized Catalan numbers can be defined by g.f. A(x) = (1-sqrt(1-q*4*x*(1-(q-1)*x)))/(2*q*x) with nonzero parameter q.  Recurrence: (n+3)*a(n+2) -2*q*(2*n+3)*a(n+1) +4*q*(q-1)*n*a(n) = 0 with a(0)=1, a(1)=1.

Asymptotic approximation for q >= 1: a(n) ~ (2*q+2*sqrt(q))^n*sqrt(2*q*(1+sqrt(q))) /sqrt(4*q^2*Pi*n^3).

For q <= -1, the g.f. defines signed sequences with asymptotic approximation: a(n) ~ Re(sqrt(2*q*(1+sqrt(q)))*(2*q+2*sqrt(q))^n) / sqrt(q^2*Pi*n^3), where Re denotes the real part. Due to Stokes' phenomena, accuracy of the asymptotic approximation deteriorates at/near certain values of n.

Special cases are A000108 (q=1), A068764 to A068772 (q=2 to 10), A240880 (q=-3).
