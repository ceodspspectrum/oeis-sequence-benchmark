Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Rencontres numbers: number of permutations of [n] with exactly one fixed point.
Comments: a(n) is also the number of permutations of [n] having no circular succession. A circular succession in a permutation p of [n] is either a pair p(i), p(i+1), where p(i+1)=p(i)+1 or the pair p(n), p(1) if p(1)=p(n)+1. a(4)=8 because we have 1324, 1432, 4132, 2143, 2413, 3214, 3241, and 4321. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Sep 06 2010

a(n) is also the number of permutations of [n] having no substring in {12, 23, ..., (n-1)n, n1}. For example, a(4) = 8 since we have 1324, 1432, 4213, 2143, 2431, 3214, 3142, 4321 (different from permutations having no circular succession). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Oct 07 2016

a(n-1) is also the number of permutations of [n] that allow the substring n1 in the set of permutations of [n] having no substring in {12, 23, ..., (n-1)n}. For example, for n=5 the 8 permutations in S5 having no substring in {12,23,34,45} that allow the substring 51 are {51324,51432,25143,24351,35142,32514,42513,43251} (see link). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 11 2017

From _Enrique Navarrete_, Mar 25 2017: (Start)

Let D(n,k) be the set of permutations on [n] that for fixed k, 0 < k < n, avoid substrings j(j+k) for 1 <= j <= n - k, and avoid substrings j(j+k) (mod n) for n-k < j <= n. Then the number of permutations in D(n,k) with k relative prime to n, n>=2, is given by a(n). For example, the forbidden substrings in D(4,3) are {14;21,32,43} (the forbidden substrings (mod 4) are written after the semicolon and lie below the diagonal in the chessboard below):

                                1 2 3 4

                             1 |_|_|_|x|

                             2 |x|_|_|_|

                             3 |_|x|_|_|

                             4 |_|_|x|_|

_

Then since 4 and 3 are relatively prime, a(4)=8, and the permutations in D(4,3) are 1234, 1342, 2341, 2413, 3124, 3412, 4123, 4231.

For another example, the forbidden substrings in D(8,5) are {16,27,38;41, 52,63,74,85} and the number of permutations in D(8,5) is a(8)=14832 (see the "K-Shift Forbidden Substrings" link).
