Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of invertible 2 X 2 matrices mod n.
Comments: For a prime p, a(p) = (p^2 - 1)*(p^2 - p) (this is the order of GL(2,p)). More generally a(n) is multiplicative: if the canonical factorization of n is the Product_{i=1..k} (p_i)^(e_i), then a(n) = Product_{i=1..k} (((p_i)^(2*e_i) - (p_i)^(2*e_i - 2)) * ((p_i)^(2*e_i) - (p_i)^(2*e_i - 1))). - Brian Wallace (wallacebrianedward(AT)yahoo.co.uk), Apr 05 2001, Dan Fux (dan.fux(AT)OpenGaia.com or danfux(AT)OpenGaia.com), Apr 18 2001

a(n) is the order of the automorphism group of the group C_n X C_n, where C_n is the cyclic group of order n. - _Laszlo Toth_, Dec 06 2011

Order of the group GL(2,Z_n). For n > 2, a(n) is divisible by 48. - _Jianing Song_, Jul 08 2018
