Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of self-dual monotone Boolean functions of n variables.
Comments: Sometimes called Hosten-Morris numbers (or HM numbers).

Also the number of simplicial complexes on the set {1, ..., n-1} such that no pair of faces covers all of {1, ..., n-1}. [Miller-Sturmfels] - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 18 2008

Also the maximal number of generators of a neighborly monomial ideal in n variables. [Miller-Sturmfels]. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 18 2008

Also the number of intersecting antichains on a labeled (n-1)-set or (n-1)-variable Boolean functions in the Post class F(7,2). Cf. A059090. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Goran Kilibarda, Dec 28 2000

Also the number of nondominated coteries on n members. - _Don Knuth_, Sep 01 2005

The number of maximal families of intersecting subsets of an n-element set. - _Bridget Tenner_, Nov 16 2006

Rivi√®re gives a(n) for n <= 5. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 12 2012
