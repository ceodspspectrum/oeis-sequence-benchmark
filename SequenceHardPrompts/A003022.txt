Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Length of shortest (or optimal) Golomb ruler with n marks.
Comments: a(n) is the least integer such that there is an n-element set of integers between 0 and a(n), the sums of pairs (of not necessarily distinct elements) of which are distinct.

From _David W. Wilson_, Aug 17 2007: (Start)

An n-mark Golomb ruler has a unique integer distance between any pair of marks and thus measures n(n-1)/2 distinct integer distances.

An optimal n-mark Golomb ruler has the smallest possible length (distance between the two end marks) for an n-mark ruler.

A perfect n-mark Golomb ruler has length exactly n(n-1)/2 and measures each distance from 1 to n(n-1)/2. (End)

Positions where A143824 increases (see also A227590). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 08 2016

From _Gus Wiseman_, May 17 2019: (Start)

Also the smallest m such that there exists a length-n composition of m for which every restriction to a subinterval has a different sum. Representatives of compositions for the first few terms are:

   0: ()

   1: (1)

   3: (2,1)

   6: (2,3,1)

  11: (3,1,5,2)

  17: (4,2,3,7,1)

Representatives of corresponding Golomb rulers are:

  {0}

  {0,1}

  {0,2,3}

  {0,2,5,6}

  {0,3,4,9,11}

  {0,4,6,9,16,17}
