Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of partitions of n if there are two kinds of 1, two kinds of 2 and two kinds of 3.
Comments: Also number of partitions of 2*n+1 with exactly 3 odd parts (offset 1). - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Jan 12 2005

Convolution of A000041 and A001399. - _Vaclav Kotesovec_, Aug 18 2015

Also the sum of binomial(D(p),3) over partitions p of n+6, where D(p) is the number of different sizes of parts in p. - _Emily Anible_, May 13 2018
