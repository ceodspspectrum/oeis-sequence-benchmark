Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of ways of writing n as a sum of 4 squares; also theta series of four-dimensional cubic lattice Z^4.
Comments: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 is one of Ramanujan's 54 universal quaternary quadratic forms. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 01 2008

a(n) is also the number of quaternions q = a + bi + cj + dk, where a, b, c, d are integers, such that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = n (i.e., so that n is the norm of q). These are Lipschitz integer quaternions. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Mar 27 2009

Number 5 and 35 of the 126 eta-quotients listed in Table 1 of Williams 2012. - _Michael Somos_, Nov 10 2018

This is the convolution square of A004018. - _Pierre Abbat_, May 15 2023
