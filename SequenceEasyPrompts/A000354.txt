Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Expansion of e.g.f. exp(-x)/(1-2*x).
Comments: a(n) is the permanent of the n X n matrix with 1's on the diagonal and 2's elsewhere. - Yuval Dekel, Nov 01 2003. Compare A157142.

Starting with offset 1 = lim_{k->infinity} M^k, where M = a tridiagonal matrix with (1,0,0,0,...) in the main diagonal, (1,3,5,7,...) in the subdiagonal and (2,4,6,8,...) in the subsubdiagonal. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 13 2009

a(n) is also the number of (n-1)-dimensional facet derangements for the n-dimensional hypercube. - Elizabeth McMahon, Gary Gordon (mcmahone(AT)lafayette.edu), Jun 29 2009

a(n) is the number of ways to write down each n-permutation and underline some (possibly none or all) of the elements that are not fixed points.  a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n} A008290(n,k)*2^(n-k). - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Dec 15 2012

Type B derangement numbers: the number of fixed point free permutations in the n-th hyperoctahedral group of signed permutations of {1,2,...,n}. See Chow 2006. See A000166 for type A derangement numbers. - _Peter Bala_, Jan 30 2015
