Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Indices of prime repunits: numbers n such that 11...111 (with n 1's) = (10^n - 1)/9 is prime.
Comments: People who search for repunit primes or repdigit primes may be looking for this entry.

The indices of primes with digital product (i.e., product of digits) equal to 1.

As of August 2014, only the first five repunits, through (10^1031-1)/9, have been proved prime. The last four repunits are known only to be probable primes and have not been proved to be prime. - _Robert Baillie_, Aug 17 2014

These indices p must also be prime. If p is not prime, say p = m*n, then 10^(m*n) - 1 = ((10^m)^n) - 1 => 10^m - 1 divides 10^(m*n) - 1. Since 9 divides 10^m - 1 or (10^m - 1)/9 = q, it follows q divides (10^p - 1)/9. This is a result of the identity, a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^(n-1) + a^(n-2)*b + ... + b^(n-1)). - _Cino Hilliard_, Dec 23 2008

The numbers R_n = 11...111 = (10^n - 1)/9 with n in this sequence A004023, except for n = 2, are prime repunits in base ten, so they are prime Brazilian numbers belonging to A085104. [See Links: Les nombres br√©siliens.] - _Bernard Schott_, Dec 24 2012

Search limit is 10800000, currently. - _Serge Batalov_, Jul 01 2021
