Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = 2*3^n*(2*n)!/(n!*(n+2)!).
Comments: Number of rooted planar maps with n edges. - _Don Knuth_, Nov 24 2013

Number of rooted 4-regular planar maps with n vertices.

Also, number of doodles with n crossings, irrespective of the number of loops.

From _Karol A. Penson_, Sep 02 2010: (Start)

Integral representation as n-th moment of a positive function on the (0,12) segment of the x axis. This representation is unique as it is the solution of the Hausdorff moment problem.

a(n) = Integral_{x=0..12} ((x^n*(4/9)*(1 - x/12)^(3/2)) / (Pi*sqrt(x/3))).  (End)

Also, the number of distinct underlying shapes of closed normal linear lambda terms of a given size, where the shape of a lambda term abstracts away from its variable binding. [N. Zeilberger, 2015] - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 18 2016

The September 2018 talk by Noam Zeilberger (see link to video) connects three topics (planar maps, Tamari lattices, lambda calculus) and eight sequences: A000168, A000260, A000309, A000698, A000699, A002005, A062980, A267827. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 17 2018

Number of well-labeled trees (Bona, 2015). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 25 2018
