Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Tetranacci numbers: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-3) + a(n-4) for n >= 4 with a(0) = a(1) = a(2) = 0 and a(3) = 1.
Comments: a(n) is the number of compositions of n-3 with no part greater than 4. Example: a(7) = 8 because we have 1+1+1+1 = 2+1+1 = 1+2+1 = 3+1 = 1+1+2 = 2+2 = 1+3 = 4. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Mar 10 2004

In other words, a(n) is the number of ways of putting stamps in one row on an envelope using stamps of denominations 1, 2, 3 and 4 cents so as to total n-3 cents [Pólya-Szegő]. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 28 2012

a(n+4) is the number of 0-1 sequences of length n that avoid 1111. - _David Callan_, Jul 19 2004

a(n) is the number of matchings in the graph obtained by a zig-zag triangulation of a convex (n-3)-gon. Example: a(8) = 15 because in the triangulation of the convex pentagon ABCDEA with diagonals AD and AC we have 15 matchings: the empty set, seven singletons and {AB,CD}, {AB,DE}, {BC,AD}, {BC,DE}, {BC,EA}, {CD,EA} and {DE,AC}. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Dec 25 2004

Number of permutations satisfying -k <= p(i)-i <= r, i=1..n-3, with k = 1, r = 3. - _Vladimir Baltic_, Jan 17 2005

For n >= 0, a(n+4) is the number of palindromic compositions of 2*n+1 into an odd number of parts that are not multiples of 4. In addition, a(n+4) is also the number of Sommerville symmetric cyclic compositions (= bilaterally symmetric cyclic compositions) of 2*n+1 into an odd number of parts that are not multiples of 4. - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Mar 10 2018

a(n) is the number of ways to tile a hexagonal double-strip (two rows of adjacent hexagons) containing (n-4) cells with hexagons and double-hexagons (two adjacent hexagons). - _Ziqian Jin_, Jul 28 2019

The term "tetranacci number" was coined by Mark Feinberg (1963; see A000073). - _Amiram Eldar_, Apr 16 2021

a(n) is the number of ways to tile a skew double-strip of n-3 cells using squares and all possible "dominos", as seen in Ziqian Jin's article, below. Here is the skew double-strip corresponding to n=15, with 12 cells:

   ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___

  |   |   |   |   |   |   |

 _|___|___|___|___|_ _|___|

|   |   |   |   |   |   |

|___|___|___|___|___|___|,

and here are the three possible "domino" tiles:

   ___     ___

  |   |   |   |

 _|  _|   |_  |_      _______

|   |       |   |    |       |

|___|,      |___|,   |_______|.

As an example, here is one of the a(15) = 1490 ways to tile the skew double-strip of 12 cells:

   ___ ___ _______ _______

  |   |   |   |   |   |   |

 _|___|_  |___|_ _|_ _|  _|

|       |   |   |   |   |

|_______|___|___|___|___|. - _Greg Dresden_, Jun 05 2024
