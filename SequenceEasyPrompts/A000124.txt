Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Central polygonal numbers (the Lazy Caterer's sequence): n(n+1)/2 + 1; or, maximal number of pieces formed when slicing a pancake with n cuts.
Comments: These are Hogben's central polygonal numbers with the (two-dimensional) symbol

2

.P

1 n

The first line cuts the pancake into 2 pieces. For n > 1, the n-th line crosses every earlier line (avoids parallelism) and also avoids every previous line intersection, thus increasing the number of pieces by n. For 16 lines, for example, the number of pieces is 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + 16 = 137. These are the triangular numbers plus 1 (cf. A000217).

m = (n-1)(n-2)/2 + 1 is also the smallest number of edges such that all graphs with n nodes and m edges are connected. - _Keith Briggs_, May 14 2004

Also maximal number of grandchildren of a binary vector of length n+2. E.g., a binary vector of length 6 can produce at most 11 different vectors when 2 bits are deleted.

This is also the order dimension of the (strong) Bruhat order on the finite Coxeter group B_{n+1}. - Nathan Reading (reading(AT)math.umn.edu), Mar 07 2002

For n >= 1 a(n) is the number of terms in the expansion of (x+y)*(x^2+y^2)*(x^3+y^3)*...*(x^n+y^n). - Yuval Dekel (dekelyuval(AT)hotmail.com), Jul 28 2003

Also the number of terms in (1)(x+1)(x^2+x+1)...(x^n+...+x+1); see A000140.

Narayana transform (analog of the binomial transform) of vector [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...] = A000124; using the infinite lower Narayana triangle of A001263 (as a matrix), N; then N * [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...] = A000124. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 28 2005

Number of interval subsets of {1, 2, 3, ..., n} (cf. A002662). - Jose Luis Arregui (arregui(AT)unizar.es), Jun 27 2006

Define a number of straight lines in the plane to be in general arrangement when (1) no two lines are parallel, (2) there is no point common to three lines. Then these are the maximal numbers of regions defined by n straight lines in general arrangement in the plane. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006

Note that a(n) = a(n-1) + A000027(n-1). This has the following geometrical interpretation: Suppose there are already n-1 lines in general arrangement, thus defining the maximal number of regions in the plane obtainable by n-1 lines and now one more line is added in general arrangement. Then it will cut each of the n-1 lines and acquire intersection points which are in general arrangement. (See the comments on A000027 for general arrangement with points.) These points on the new line define the maximal number of regions in 1-space definable by n-1 points, hence this is A000027(n-1), where for A000027 an offset of 0 is assumed, that is, A000027(n-1) = (n+1)-1 = n. Each of these regions acts as a dividing wall, thereby creating as many new regions in addition to the a(n-1) regions already there, hence a(n) = a(n-1) + A000027(n-1). Cf. the comments on A000125 for an analogous interpretation. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006

When constructing a zonohedron, one zone at a time, out of (up to) 3-d non-intersecting parallelepipeds, the n-th element of this sequence is the number of edges in the n-th zone added with the n-th "layer" of parallelepipeds. (Verified up to 10-zone zonohedron, the enneacontahedron.) E.g., adding the 10th zone to the enneacontahedron requires 46 parallel edges (edges in the 10th zone) by looking directly at a 5-valence vertex and counting visible vertices. - _Shel Kaphan_, Feb 16 2006

Binomial transform of (1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...) and inverse binomial transform of A072863: (1, 3, 9, 26, 72, 192, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 15 2007

Also number of distinct sums of 1 through n where each of those can be + or -. E.g., {1+2,1-2,-1+2,-1-2} = {3,-1,1,-3} and a(2) = 4. - _Toby Gottfried_, Nov 17 2011

This sequence is complete because the sum of the first n terms is always greater than or equal to a(n+1)-1. Consequently, any nonnegative number can be written as a sum of distinct terms of this sequence. See A204009, A072638. - _Frank M Jackson_, Jan 09 2012

n points in general position determine "n choose 2" lines, so A055503(n) <= a(n(n-1)/2). If n > 3, the lines are not in general position and so A055503(n) < a(n(n-1)/2). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 01 2015

Numbers m such that 8m - 7 is a square. - _Bruce J. Nicholson_, Jul 24 2017

From _Klaus Purath_, Jan 29 2020: (Start)

The odd prime factors != 7 occur in an interval of p successive terms either never or exactly twice, while 7 always occurs only once. If a prime factor p appears in a(n) and a(m) within such an interval, then n + m == -1 (mod p). When 7 divides a(n), then 2*n == -1 (mod 7). a(n) is never divisible by the prime numbers given in A003625.

While all prime factors p != 7 can occur to any power, a(n) is never divisible by 7^2. The prime factors are given in A045373. The prime terms of this sequence are given in A055469.

a(n-1) is the greatest sum of arch lengths for the top arches of a semi-meander with n arches. An arch length is the number of arches covered + 1.

      /\   The top arch has a length of 3.  /\   The top arch has a length of 3.

     /  \  Both bottom arches have a       //\\  The middle arch has a length of 2.

    //\/\\ length of 1.                   ///\\\ The bottom arch has a length of 1.

For n> 0, let the n-dimensional cube {0,1}^n be, provided with the Hamming distance, d. Given an element x in {0,1}^n, a(n) is the number of elements y in {0,1}^n such that d(x, y) <= 2.
