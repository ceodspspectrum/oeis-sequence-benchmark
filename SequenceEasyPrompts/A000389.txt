Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Binomial coefficients C(n,5).
Comments: a(n+4) is the number of inequivalent ways of coloring the vertices of a regular 4-dimensional simplex with n colors, under the full symmetric group S_5 of order 120, with cycle index (x1^5 + 10*x1^3*x2 + 20*x1^2*x3 + 15*x1*x2^2 + 30*x1*x4 + 20*x2*x3 + 24*x5)/120.

Figurate numbers based on 5-dimensional regular simplex. According to Hyun Kwang Kim, it appears that every nonnegative integer can be represented as the sum of g = 10 of these 5-simplex(n) numbers (compared with g=3 for triangular numbers, g=5 for tetrahedral numbers and g=8 for pentatope numbers). - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Nov 28 2004

The convolution of the nonnegative integers (A001477) with the tetrahedral numbers (A000292), which are the convolution of the nonnegative integers with themselves (making appropriate allowances for offsets of all sequences). - _Graeme McRae_, Jun 07 2006

a(n) is the number of terms in the expansion of (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6)^n. - _Sergio Falcon_, Feb 12 2007

Product of five consecutive numbers divided by 120. - _Artur Jasinski_, Dec 02 2007

Equals binomial transform of [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...]. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Feb 02 2009

Equals INVERTi transform of A099242 (1, 7, 34, 153, 686, 3088, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Feb 02 2009

For a team with n basketball players (n>=5), this sequence is the number of possible starting lineups of 5 players, without regard to the positions (center, forward, guard) of the players. - _Mohammad K. Azarian_, Sep 10 2009

a(n) is the number of different patterns, regardless of order, when throwing (n-5) 6-sided dice. For example, one die can display the 6 numbers 1, 2, ..., 6; two dice can display the 21 digit-pairs 11, 12, ..., 56, 66. - _Ian Duff_, Nov 16 2009

Sum of the first n pentatope numbers (1, 5, 15, 35, 70, 126, 210, ...), see A000332. - _Paul Muljadi_, Dec 16 2009

Sum_{n>=0} a(n)/n! = e/120. Sum_{n>=4} a(n)/(n-4)! = 501*e/120. See A067764 regarding the second ratio. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Dec 26 2013

For a set of integers {1,2,...,n}, a(n) is the sum of the 2 smallest elements of each subset with 4 elements, which is 3*C(n+1,5) (for n>=4), hence a(n) = 3*C(n+1,5) = 3*A000389(n+1). - _Serhat Bulut_, Mar 11 2015

a(n) = fallfac(n,5)/5! is also the number of independent components of an antisymmetric tensor of rank 5 and dimension n >= 1. Here fallfac is the falling factorial. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 10 2015

Number of compositions (ordered partitions) of n+1 into exactly 6 parts. - _Juergen Will_, Jan 02 2016

Number of weak compositions (ordered weak partitions) of n-5 into exactly 6 parts. - _Juergen Will_, Jan 02 2016

a(n+3) could be the general number of all geodetic graphs of diameter n>=2 homeomorphic to the Petersen Graph. - _Carlos Enrique Frasser_, May 24 2018

From _Robert A. Russell_, Dec 24 2020: (Start)

a(n) is the number of chiral pairs of colorings of the 5 tetrahedral facets (or vertices) of the regular 4-D simplex (5-cell, pentachoron, SchlÃ¤fli symbol {3,3,3}) using subsets of a set of n colors. Each member of a chiral pair is a reflection but not a rotation of the other.

a(n+4) is the number of unoriented colorings of the 5 tetrahedral facets of the regular 4-D simplex (5-cell, pentachoron) using subsets of a set of n colors. Each chiral pair is counted as one when enumerating unoriented arrangements. (End)

For integer m and positive integer r >= 4, the polynomial a(n) + a(n + m) + a(n + 2*m) + ... + a(n + r*m) in n has its zeros on the vertical line Re(n) = (4 - r*m)/2 in the complex plane. - _Peter Bala_, Jun 02 2024
