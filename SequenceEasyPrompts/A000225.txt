Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```

With offset 0 and another initial 0, the n-th term of 0, 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, ... is the number of commas required in the fully-expanded von Neumann definition of the ordinal number n. For example, 4 := {0, 1, 2, 3} := {{}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}}, {{}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}}}}, which uses seven commas. Also, for n>0, a(n) is the total number of symbols required in the fully-expanded von Neumann definition of ordinal n - 1, where a single symbol (as usual) is always used to represent the empty set and spaces are ignored.

Also, number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height n-1, or: number of squares (or triangles) after the n-th step of the construction of a Pythagorean tree: Start with a segment. At each step, construct squares having the most recent segment(s) as base, and isoceles right triangles having the opposite side of the squares as hypotenuse ("on top" of each square).
