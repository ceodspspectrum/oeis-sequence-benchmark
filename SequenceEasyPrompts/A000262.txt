Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Number of "sets of lists": number of partitions of {1,...,n} into any number of lists, where a list means an ordered subset.
Comments: Determinant of n X n matrix M=[m(i,j)] where m(i,i)=i, m(i,j)=1 if i > j, m(i,j)=i-j if j > i. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Jan 19 2003

With p(n) = the number of integer partitions of n, d(i) = the number of different parts of the i-th partition of n, m(i,j) = multiplicity of the j-th part of the i-th partition of n, Sum_{i=1..p(n)} = sum over i and Product_{j=1..d(i)} = product over j, one has: a(n) = Sum_{i=1..p(n)} n!/(Product_{j=1..d(i)} m(i,j)!). - _Thomas Wieder_, May 18 2005

Consider all n! permutations of the integer sequence [n] = 1,2,3,...,n. The i-th permutation, i=1,2,...,n!, consists of Z(i) permutation cycles. Such a cycle has the length lc(i,j), j=1,...,Z(i). For a given permutation we form the product of all its cycle lengths Product_{j=1..Z(i)} lc(i,j). Furthermore, we sum up all such products for all permutations of [n] which gives Sum_{i=1..n!} Product_{j=1..Z(i)} lc(i,j) = A000262(n). For n=4 we have Sum_{i=1..n!} Product_{j=1..Z(i)} lc(i,j) = 1*1*1*1 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 2*1 + 3*1 + 4 + 3*1 + 4 + 2*2 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 4 + 3*1 + 2*1*1 + 2*2 + 4 + 2*2 + 4 + 3*1 + 2*1*1 + 3*1 + 4 = 73 = A000262(4). - _Thomas Wieder_, Oct 06 2006

For a finite set S of size n, a chain gang G of S is a partially ordered set (S,<=) consisting only of chains. The number of chain gangs of S is a(n). For example, with S={a, b}and n=2, there are a(2)=3 chain gangs of S, namely, {(a,a),(b,b)}, {(a,a),(a,b),(b,b)} and {(a,a),(b,a),(b,b)}. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Feb 22 2007

(-1)*A000262 with the first term set to 1 and A084358 form a reciprocal pair under the list partition transform and associated operations described in A133314. Cf. A133289. - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 21 2007

Consider the distribution of n unlabeled elements "1" onto n levels where empty levels are allowed. In addition, the empty levels are labeled. Their names are 0_1, 0_2, 0_3, etc. This sequence gives the total number of such distributions. If the empty levels are unlabeled ("0"), then the answer is A001700. Let the colon ":" separate two levels. Then, for example, for n=3 we have a(3)=13 arrangements: 111:0_1:0_2, 0_1:111:0_2, 0_1:0_2:111, 111:0_2:0_1, 0_2:111:0_1, 0_2:0_1:111, 11:1:0, 11:0:1, 0:11:1, 1:11:0, 1:0:11, 0:1:11, 1:1:1. - _Thomas Wieder_, May 25 2008

Row sums of exponential Riordan array [1,x/(1-x)]. - _Paul Barry_, Jul 24 2008

a(n) is the number of partitions of [n] (A000110) into lists of noncrossing sets. For example, a(3)=3 counts 12, 1-2, 2-1 and a(4) = 73 counts the 75 partitions of [n] into lists of sets (A000670) except for 13-24, 24-13 which fail to be noncrossing. - _David Callan_, Jul 25 2008

a(i-j)/(i-j)! gives the value of the non-null element (i, j) of the lower triangular matrix exp(S)/exp(1), where S is the lower triangular matrix - of whatever dimension - having all its (non-null) elements equal to one. - _Giuliano Cabrele_, Aug 11 2008, Sep 07 2008

a(n) is also the number of nilpotent partial one-one bijections (of an n-element set). Equivalently, it is the number of nilpotents in the symmetric inverse semigroup (monoid). - _Abdullahi Umar_, Sep 14 2008

A000262 is the exp transform of the factorial numbers A000142. - _Thomas Wieder_, Sep 10 2008

If n is a positive integer then the infinite continued fraction (1+n)/(1+(2+n)/(2+(3+n)/(3+...))) converges to the rational number A052852(n)/A000262(n). - David Angell (angell(AT)maths.unsw.edu.au), Dec 18 2008

_Vladeta Jovovic_'s formula dated Sep 20 2006 can be restated as follows: a(n) is the n-th ascending factorial moment of the Poisson distribution with parameter (mean) 1. - Shai Covo (green355(AT)netvision.net.il), Jan 25 2010

The umbral exponential generating function for a(n) is (1-x)^{-B}. In other words, write (1-x)^{-B} as a power series in x whose coefficients are polynomials in B, and then replace B^k with the Bell number B_k. We obtain a(0) + a(1)x + a(2)x^2/2! + ... . - _Richard Stanley_, Jun 07 2010

a(n) is the number of Dyck n-paths (A000108) with its peaks labeled 1,2,...,k in some order, where k is the number of peaks. For example a(2)=3 counts U(1)DU(2)D, U(2)DU(1)D, UU(1)DD where the label at each peak is in parentheses. This is easy to prove using generating functions. - _David Callan_, Aug 23 2011

a(n) = number of permutations of the multiset {1,1,2,2,...,n,n} such that for 1 <= i <= n, all entries between the two i's exceed i and if any such entries are present, they include n. There are (2n-1)!! permutations satisfying the first condition, and for example: a(3)=13 counts all 5!!=15 of them except 331221 and 122133 which fail the second condition. - _David Callan_, Aug 27 2014_

a(n) is the number of acyclic, injective functions from subsets of [n] to [n]. Let subset D of [n] have size k. The number of acyclic, injective functions from D to [n] is (n-1)!/(n-k-1)! and hence a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n-1} binomial(n,k)*(n-1)!/(n-k-1)!. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Nov 05 2015

a(n) is the number of acyclic, injective, labeled directed graphs on n vertices with each vertex having outdegree at most one. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Nov 05 2015

For n > 0, a(n) is the number of labeled-rooted skinny-tree forests on n nodes. A skinny tree is a tree in which each vertex has at most one child. Let k denote the number of trees. There are binomial(n,k) ways to choose the roots, binomial(n-1,k-1) ways to choose the number of descendants for each root, and (n-k)! ways to permute those descendants. Summing over k, we obtain a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} C(n,k)*C(n-1,k-1)*(n-k)!. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Nov 10 2015

This is the Sheffer transform of the Bell numbers A000110 with the Sheffer matrix S = |Stirling1| = (1, -log(1-x)) = A132393. See the e.g.f. formula, a Feb 21 2017 comment on A048993, and R. Stanley's Jun 07 2010 comment above. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 21 2017

All terms = {1, 3} mod 10. - _Muniru A Asiru_, Oct 01 2017

We conjecture that for k = 2,3,4,..., the difference a(n+k) - a(n) is divisible by k: if true, then for each k the sequence a(n) taken modulo k is periodic with period dividing k. - _Peter Bala_, Nov 14 2017

The above conjecture is true - see the Bala link. - _Peter Bala_, Jan 20 2018

The terms of this sequence can be derived from the numerators of the fractions, produced by the recursion: b(0) = 1, b(n) = 1 + ((n-1) * b(n-1)) / (n-1 + b(n-1)) for n > 0. The denominators give A002720. - _Dimitris Valianatos_, Aug 01 2018

a(n) is the number of rooted labeled forests on n nodes that avoid the patterns 213, 312, and 123. It is also the number of rooted labeled forests that avoid 312, 213, and 132, as well as the number of rooted labeled forests that avoid 132, 213, and 321. - _Kassie Archer_, Aug 30 2018

For n > 0, a(n) is the number of partitions of [2n-1] whose nontrivial blocks are of type {a,b}, with a <= n and b > n. In fact, for n > 0, a(n) = A056953(2n-1). - _Francesca Aicardi_, Nov 03 2022

For n > 0, a(n) is the number of ways to split n people into nonempty groups, have each group sit around a circular table, and select one person from each table (where two seating arrangements are considered identical if each person has the same left neighbors in both of them). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Oct 01 2023
