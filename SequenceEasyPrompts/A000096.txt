Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = n*(n+3)/2.
Comments: For n >= 1, a(n) is the maximal number of pieces that can be obtained by cutting an annulus with n cuts. See illustration. - _Robert G. Wilson v_

n(n-3)/2 (n >= 3) is the number of diagonals of an n-gon. - Antreas P. Hatzipolakis (xpolakis(AT)otenet.gr)

n(n-3)/2 (n >= 4) is the degree of the third-smallest irreducible presentation of the symmetric group S_n (cf. James and Kerber, Appendix 1).

a(n) is also the multiplicity of the eigenvalue (-2) of the triangle graph Delta(n+1). (See p. 19 in Biggs.) - Felix Goldberg (felixg(AT)tx.technion.ac.il), Nov 25 2001

For n > 3, a(n-3) = dimension of the traveling salesman polytope T(n). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Aug 18 2002

Coefficient of x^2 in (1 + x + 2*x^2)^n. - _Michael Somos_, May 26 2004

a(n) is the number of "prime" n-dimensional polyominoes. A "prime" n-polyomino cannot be formed by connecting any other n-polyominoes except for the n-monomino and the n-monomino is not prime. E.g., for n=1, the 1-monomino is the line of length 1 and the only "prime" 1-polyominoes are the lines of length 2 and 3. This refers to "free" n-dimensional polyominoes, i.e., that can be rotated along any axis. - Bryan Jacobs (bryanjj(AT)gmail.com), Apr 01 2005

Solutions to the quadratic equation q(m, r) = (-3 +- sqrt(9 + 8(m - r))) / 2, where m - r is included in a(n). Let t(m) = the triangular number (A000217) less than some number k and r = k - t(m). If k is neither prime nor a power of two and m - r is included in A000096, then m - q(m, r) will produce a value that shares a divisor with k. - _Andrew S. Plewe_, Jun 18 2005

Sum_{k=2..n+1} 4/(k*(k+1)*(k-1)) = ((n+3)*n)/((n+2)*(n+1)). Numerator(Sum_{k=2..n+1} 4/(k*(k+1)*(k-1))) = (n+3)*n/2. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Apr 11 2006

Number of rooted trees with n+3 nodes of valence 1, no nodes of valence 2 and exactly two other nodes. I.e., number of planted trees with n+2 leaves and exactly two branch points. - Theo Johnson-Freyd (theojf(AT)berkeley.edu), Jun 10 2007

The only primes are a(1) = 2 and a(2) = 5. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jul 18 2011

a(n) = m such that the (m+1)-th triangular number minus the m-th triangular number is the (n+1)-th triangular number: (m+1)(m+2)/2 - m(m+1)/2 = (n+1)(n+2)/2. - _Zak Seidov_, Jan 22 2012

For n >= 1, number of different values that Sum_{k=1..n} c(k)*k can take where the c(k) are 0 or 1. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jun 24 2012

On an n X n chessboard (n >= 2), the number of possible checkmate positions in the case of king and rook versus a lone king is 0, 16, 40, 72, 112, 160, 216, 280, 352, ..., which is 8*a(n-2). For a 4 X 4 board the number is 40. The number of positions possible was counted including all mirror images and rotations for all four sides of the board. - _Jose Abutal_, Nov 19 2013

If k = a(i-1) or k = a(i+1) and n = k + a(i), then C(n, k-1), C(n, k), C(n, k+1) are three consecutive binomial coefficients in arithmetic progression and these are all the solutions. There are no four consecutive binomial coefficients in arithmetic progression. - _Michael Somos_, Nov 11 2015

Let phi_(D,rho) be the average value of a generic degree D monic polynomial f when evaluated at the roots of the rho-th derivative of f, expressed as a polynomial in the averaged symmetric polynomials in the roots of f. [See the Wojnar et al. link] The "last" term of phi_(D,rho) is a multiple of the product of all roots of f; the coefficient is expressible as a polynomial h_D(N) in N:=D-rho. These polynomials are of the form h_D(N)= ((-1)^D/(D-1)!)*(D-N)*N^chi*g_D(N) where chi = (1 if D is odd, 0 if D is even) and g_D(N) is a monic polynomial of degree (D-2-chi). Then a(n) are the negated coefficients of the next to the highest order term in the polynomials N^chi*g_D(N), starting at D=3. - _Gregory Gerard Wojnar_, Jul 19 2017
