Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Period 2: repeat [1, 2]; a(n) = 1 + (n mod 2).
Comments: Also continued fraction for (sqrt(3)+1)/2 (cf. A040001) and base-3 digital root of n+1 (cf. A007089, A010888). - _Henry Bottomley_, Jul 05 2001

The sequence 1,-2,-1,2,1,-2,-1,2,... with g.f. (1-2x)/(1+x^2) has a(n) = cos(Pi*n/2)-2*sin(Pi*n/2). - _Paul Barry_, Oct 18 2004

Hankel transform is [1,-3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,...]. - _Philippe Deléham_, Mar 29 2007

4/33 = 0.121212... - _Eric Desbiaux_, Nov 03 2008

Let A be the Hessenberg matrix of order n, defined by: A[1,j]=A[i,i]:=1, A[i,i-1]=-1, and A[i,j]=0 otherwise. Then, for n>=1, a(n-1) = charpoly(A,2). - _Milan Janjic_, Jan 24 2010

First differences of A032766. - _Tom Edgar_, Jul 17 2014

Denominator of the harmonic mean of the first n triangular numbers. - _Colin Barker_, Nov 13 2014

This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that no polynomial of degree d can be fitted to d+2 consecutive terms (equivalently, such that no iterated difference is zero). - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Dec 26 2021 [See A300002 for the case where not only consecutive terms are considered. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Jan 03 2023]

Number of maximum antichains in the power set of {1,2,...,n} partially ordered by set inclusion. For even n, there is a unique maximum antichain formed by all subsets of size n/2; for odd n, there are two maximum antichains, one formed by all subsets of size (n-1)/2 and the other formed by all subsets of size (n+1)/2. See the David Guichard link below for a proof. - _Jianing Song_, Jun 19 2022
