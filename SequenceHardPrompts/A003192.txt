Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Length of uncrossed knight's path on an n X n board.
Comments: I used ZDD techniques to show that a(9)=47. (This is the longest uncrossed knight's path on a 9 X 9 board; thus I confirmed the conjecture that the paths of length 47, found by hand long ago, are indeed optimum.) - _Don Knuth_, Jun 24 2010
