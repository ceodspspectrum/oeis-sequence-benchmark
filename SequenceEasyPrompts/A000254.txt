Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Unsigned Stirling numbers of first kind, s(n+1,2): a(n+1) = (n+1)*a(n) + n!.
Comments: Number of permutations of n+1 elements with exactly two cycles.

Number of cycles in all permutations of [n]. Example: a(3) = 11 because the permutations (1)(2)(3), (1)(23), (12)(3), (13)(2), (132), (123) have 11 cycles altogether. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Aug 12 2004

Row sums of A094310: In the symmetric group S_n, each permutation factors into k independent cycles; a(n) = sum k over S_n. - Harley Flanders (harley(AT)umich.edu), Jun 28 2004

The sum of the top levels of the last column over all deco polyominoes of height n. A deco polyomino is a directed column-convex polyomino in which the height, measured along the diagonal, is attained only in the last column. Example: a(2)=3 because the deco polyominoes of height 2 are the vertical and horizontal dominoes, the levels of their last columns being 2 and 1, respectively. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Aug 12 2006

a(n) is divisible by n for all composite n >= 6. a(2*n) is divisible by 2*n + 1. - _Leroy Quet_, May 20 2007

For n >= 2 the determinant of the n-1 X n-1 matrix M(i,j) = i + 2 for i = j and 1 otherwise (i,j = 1..n-1). E.g., for n = 3 the determinant of [(3, 1), (1, 4)]. See 53rd Putnam Examination, 1992, Problem B5. - _Franz Vrabec_, Jan 13 2008, Mar 26 2008

The numerator of the fraction when we sum (without simplification) the terms in the harmonic sequence. (1 + 1/2 = 2/2 + 1/2 = 3/2; 3/2 + 1/3 = 9/6 + 2/6 = 11/6; 11/6 + 1/4 = 44/24 + 6/24 = 50/24;...). The denominator of this fraction is n!*A000142. - _Eric Desbiaux_, Jan 07 2009

The asymptotic expansion of the higher order exponential integral E(x,m=2,n=1) ~ exp(-x)/x^2*(1 - 3/x + 11/x^2 - 50/x^3 + 274/x^4 - 1764/x^5 + 13068/x^6 - ...) leads to the sequence given above. See A163931 and A028421 for more information. - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Oct 20 2009

a(n) is the number of permutations of [n+1] containing exactly 2 cycles. Example: a(2) = 3 because the permutations (1)(23), (12)(3), (13)(2) are the only permutations of [3] with exactly 2 cycles. - Tom Woodward (twoodward(AT)macalester.edu), Nov 12 2009

It appears that, with the exception of n= 4, a(n) mod n = 0 if n is composite and = n-1 if n is prime. - _Gary Detlefs_, Sep 11 2010

a(n) is a multiple of A025527(n). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 16 2012

Numerator of harmonic number H(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} 1/i when not reduced. See A001008 (Wolstenholme numbers) for the reduced numerators. - _Rahul Jha_, Feb 18 2015

The Stirling transform of this sequence is A222058(n) (Harmonic-geometric numbers). - _Anton Zakharov_, Aug 07 2016

a(n) is the (n-1)-st elementary symmetric function of the first n numbers. - _Anton Zakharov_, Nov 02 2016

The n-th iterated integral of log(x) is x^n * (n! * log(x) - a(n))/(n!)^2 + a polynomial of degree n-1 with arbitrary coefficients. This can be proven using the recurrence relation a(n) = (n-1)! + n*a(n-1). - _Mohsen Maesumi_, Oct 31 2018

Primes p such that p^3 | a(p-1) are the Wolstenholme primes A088164. - _Amiram Eldar_ and _Thomas Ordowski_, Aug 08 2019

Total number of left-to-right maxima (or minima) in all permutations of [n]. a(3) = 11 = 3+2+2+2+1+1: (1)(2)(3), (1)(3)2, (2)1(3), (2)(3)1, (3)12, (3)21. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Aug 01 2020
