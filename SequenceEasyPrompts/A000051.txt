Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = 2^n + 1.
Comments: Same as Pisot sequence L(2,3).

Length of the continued fraction for Sum_{k=0..n} 1/3^(2^k). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Nov 12 2003

See also A004119 for a(n) = 2a(n-1)-1 with first term = 1. - _Philippe Deléham_, Feb 20 2004

From the second term on (n>=1), in base 2, these numbers present the pattern 1000...0001 (with n-1 zeros), which is the "opposite" of the binary 2^n-2: (0)111...1110 (cf. A000918). - _Alexandre Wajnberg_, May 31 2005

Let A be the Hessenberg matrix of order n, defined by: A[1,j]=1, A[i,i]:=5, (i>1), A[i,i-1]=-1, and A[i,j]=0 otherwise. Then, for n>=1, a(n-1)=(-1)^(n-1)* charpoly(A,3). - _Milan Janjic_, Jan 27 2010

First differences of A006127. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Apr 14 2011

The odd prime numbers in this sequence form A019434, the Fermat primes. - _David W. Wilson_, Nov 16 2011

Pisano period lengths: 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 6, 4, 10, 2, 12, 3, 4, 1, 8, 6, 18, 4, ... . - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 10 2012

Is the mentioned Pisano period lengths (see above) the same as A007733? - _Omar E. Pol_, Aug 10 2012

Only positive integers that are not 1 mod (2k+1) for any k>1. - _Jon Perry_, Oct 16 2012

For n >= 1, a(n) is the total length of the segments of the Hilbert curve after n iterations. - _Kival Ngaokrajang_, Mar 30 2014

Frénicle de Bessy (1657) proved that a(3) = 9 is the only square in this sequence. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 13 2014

a(n) is the number of distinct possible sums made with at most two elements in {1,...,a(n-1)} for n > 0. - _Derek Orr_, Dec 13 2014

For n > 0, given any set of a(n) lattice points in R^n, there exist 2 distinct members in this set whose midpoint is also a lattice point. - _Melvin Peralta_, Jan 28 2017

Also the number of independent vertex sets, irredundant sets, and vertex covers in the (n+1)-star graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Aug 04 and Sep 21 2017

Also the number of maximum matchings in the 2(n-1)-crossed prism graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Dec 31 2017

Conjecture: For any integer n >= 0, a(n) is the permanent of the (n+1) X (n+1) matrix with M(j, k) = -floor((j - k - 1)/(n + 1)). This conjecture is inspired by the conjecture of _Zhi-Wei Sun_ in A036968. - _Peter Luschny_, Sep 07 2021
