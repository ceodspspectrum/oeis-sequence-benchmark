Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```

From _Matthew Vandermast_, Oct 31 2010: (Start)

1) When sequence is read as a regular triangular array, T(n,k) is the coefficient of the k-th power in the expansion of (x^(n+1)-1)/(x-1).

2) Sequence can also be read as a uninomial array with rows of length 1, analogous to arrays of binomial, trinomial, etc., coefficients. In a q-nomial array, T(n,k) is the coefficient of the k-th power in the expansion of ((x^q -1)/(x-1))^n, and row n has a sum of q^n and a length of (q-1)*n + 1. (End)

The number of maximal self-avoiding walks from the NW to SW corners of a 2 X n grid.

When considered as a rectangular array, A000012 is a member of the chain of accumulation arrays that includes the multiplication table A003991 of the positive integers. The chain is ... < A185906 < A000007 < A000012 < A003991 < A098358 < A185904 < A185905 < ... (See A144112 for the definition of accumulation array.) - _Clark Kimberling_, Feb 06 2011

a(n) = A007310(n+1) (Modd 3) := A193680(A007310(n+1)), n>=0. For general Modd n (not to be confused with mod n) see a comment on A203571. The nonnegative members of the three residue classes Modd 3, called [0], [1], and [2], are shown in the array A088520, if there the third row is taken as class [0] after inclusion of 0. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 09 2012

As a lower triangular array, T is an example of the fundamental generalized factorial matrices of A133314. Multiplying each n-th diagonal by t^n gives M(t) = I/(I-t*S) = I + t*S + (t*S)^2 + ... where S is the shift operator A129184, and T = M(1). The inverse of M(t) is obtained by multiplying the first subdiagonal of T by -t and the other subdiagonals by zero, so A167374 is the inverse of T. Multiplying by t^n/n! gives exp(t*S) with inverse exp(-t*S). - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 10 2012

The original definition of the meter was one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth's equator to the North Pole. According to that historical definition, the length of one degree of latitude, that is, 60 nautical miles, would be exactly 111111.111... meters. - _Jean-François Alcover_, Jun 02 2013

Consider n >= 1 nonintersecting spheres each with surface area S. Define point p on sphere S_i to be a "public point" if and only if there exists a point q on sphere S_j, j != i, such that line segment pq INTERSECT S_i = {p} and pq INTERSECT S_j = {q}; otherwise, p is a "private point". The total surface area composed of exactly all private points on all n spheres is a(n)*S = S. ("The Private Planets Problem" in Zeitz.) - _Rick L. Shepherd_, May 29 2014
