Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(0) = 1, a(1) = 4, and a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) for n >= 2.
Comments: a(n-1) = Sum_{k=0..ceiling((n-1)/2)} P(4;n-1-k,k), n >= 1, with a(-1)=3. These are the sums over the SW-NE diagonals in P(4;n,k), the (4,1) Pascal triangle A093561. Observation by _Paul Barry_, Apr 29 2004. Proof via recursion relations and comparison of inputs. Also SW-NE diagonal sums in the Pascal (1,3) triangle A095660.

In general, for a Fibonacci sequence beginning with 1,b we have a(n) = (2^(-1-n)*((1-sqrt(5))^n*(1+sqrt(5)-2b) + (1+sqrt(5))^n*(-1+sqrt(5)+2b)))/sqrt(5). In this case we have b=4. - _Herbert Kociemba_, Dec 18 2011

Pisano period lengths: 1, 3, 8, 6, 20, 24, 16, 12, 24, 60, 5, 24, 28, 48, 40, 24, 36, 24, 18, 60, ... - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 10 2012

a(n) = number of independent vertex subsets (i.e., the Merrifield-Simmons index) of the tree obtained from the path tree P_{n-1} by attaching two pendant edges to one of its endpoints (n >= 2). Example: if n=3, then we have the star tree with edges ab, ac, ad; it has 9 independent vertex subsets: empty, a, b, c, d, bc, cd, bd, bcd.

For n >= 2, the number a(n-1) is the dimension of a commutative Hecke algebra of type D_n with independent parameters. See Theorem 1.4 and Corollary 1.5 in the link "Hecke algebras with independent parameters". - _Jia Huang_, Jan 20 2019

For n >= 1, a(n) is the number of edge covers of the tadpole graph T_{3,n-1} with T_{3,0} interpreted as just the cycle C_3. Example: If n=2, we have C_3 and P_1 joined by a bridge, which is just the triangle with a pendant, and this graph has 5 edge covers. In general, because of the path portion of the graph, the number of edge covers of T{3,n-1} satisfies the same recurrence as Fibonacci sequence and it starts with 4,5. - _Feryal Alayont_, Aug 27 2023

Eswarathasan (1978) called these numbers "pseudo-Fibonacci numbers", and proved that 1, 4, and 9 are the only squares in this sequence. If the recurrence is extended to negative indices, then there is only one more square, a(-9) = 81. Eswarathasan (1979) proved that none of the terms (even with negative indices) are twice a square. - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 09 2024

For n>2, a(n) + (-1)^ceiling(n/2) is the number of ways to tile this strip of length n-1, with a central staircase, using unit squares and dominoes:
