Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of hexagonal polyominoes (or hexagonal polyforms, or planar polyhexes) with n cells.
Comments: From _Markus Voege_, Nov 24 2009: (Start)

On the difference between this sequence and A038147:

The first term that differs is for n=6; for all subsequent terms, the number of polyhexes is larger than the number of planar polyhexes.

If I recall correctly, polyhexes are clusters of regular hexagons that are joined at the edges and are LOCALLY embeddable in the hexagonal lattice.

"Planar polyhexes" are polyhexes that are GLOBALLY embeddable in the honeycomb lattice.

Example: (Planar) polyhex with 6 cells (x) and a hole (O):

.. x x

. x O x

.. x x

Polyhex with 6 cells that is cut open (I):

.. xIx

. x O x

.. x x

This polyhex is not globally embeddable in the honeycomb lattice, since adjacent cells of the lattice must be joined. But it can be embedded locally everywhere. It is a start of a spiral. For n>6 the spiral can be continued so that the cells overlap.

Illegal configuration with cut (I):

.. xIx

. x x x

.. x x

This configuration is NOT a polyhex since the vertex at

.. xIx

... x

is not embeddable in the honeycomb lattice.

One has to keep in mind that these definitions are inspired by chemistry. Hence, potential molecules are often the motivation for these definitions. Think of benzene rings that are fused at a C-C bond.

The (planar) polyhexes are "free" configurations, in contrast to "fixed" configurations as in A001207 = Number of fixed hexagonal polyominoes with n cells.

A000228 (planar polyhexes) and A001207 (fixed hexagonal polyominoes) differ only by the attribute "free" vs. "fixed," that is, whether the different orientations and reflections of an embedding in the lattice are counted.

The configuration

. x x .... x

.. x .... x x

is counted once as free and twice as fixed configurations.

Since most configurations have no symmetry, (A001207 / A000228) -> 12 for n -> infinity. (End)
