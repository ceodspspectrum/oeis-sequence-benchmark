Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Number of self-inverse permutations on n letters, also known as involutions; number of standard Young tableaux with n cells.
Comments: a(n) is also the number of n X n symmetric permutation matrices.

a(n) is also the number of matchings (Hosoya index) in the complete graph K(n). - Ola Veshta (olaveshta(AT)my-deja.com), Mar 25 2001

a(n) is also the number of independent vertex sets and vertex covers in the n-triangular graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, May 22 2017

Equivalently, this is the number of graphs on n labeled nodes with degrees at most 1. - _Don Knuth_, Mar 31 2008

a(n) is also the sum of the degrees of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group S_n. - Avi Peretz (njk(AT)netvision.net.il), Apr 01 2001

a(n) is the number of partitions of a set of n distinguishable elements into sets of size 1 and 2. - _Karol A. Penson_, Apr 22 2003

Number of tableaux on the edges of the star graph of order n, S_n (sometimes T_n). - _Roberto E. Martinez II_, Jan 09 2002

The Hankel transform of this sequence is A000178 (superfactorials). Sequence is also binomial transform of the sequence 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 15, 0, 105, 0, 945, ... (A001147 with interpolated zeros). - _Philippe Del√©ham_, Jun 10 2005

Row sums of the exponential Riordan array (e^(x^2/2),x). - _Paul Barry_, Jan 12 2006

a(n) is the number of nonnegative lattice paths of upsteps U = (1,1) and downsteps D = (1,-1) that start at the origin and end on the vertical line x = n in which each downstep (if any) is marked with an integer between 1 and the height of its initial vertex above the x-axis. For example, with the required integer immediately preceding each downstep, a(3) = 4 counts UUU, UU1D, UU2D, U1DU. - _David Callan_, Mar 07 2006

Equals row sums of triangle A152736 starting with offset 1. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 12 2008

Proof of the recurrence relation a(n) = a(n-1) + (n-1)*a(n-2): number of involutions of [n] containing n as a fixed point is a(n-1); number of involutions of [n] containing n in some cycle (j, n), where 1 <= j <= n-1, is (n-1) times the number of involutions of [n] containing the cycle (n-1 n) = (n-1)*a(n-2). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jun 08 2009

Number of ballot sequences (or lattice permutations) of length n. A ballot sequence B is a string such that, for all prefixes P of B, h(i) >= h(j) for i < j, where h(x) is the number of times x appears in P. For example, the ballot sequences of length 4 are 1111, 1112, 1121, 1122, 1123, 1211, 1212, 1213, 1231, and 1234. The string 1221 does not appear in the list because in the 3-prefix 122 there are two 2's but only one 1. (Cf. p. 176 of Bruce E. Sagan: "The Symmetric Group"). - _Joerg Arndt_, Jun 28 2009

Number of standard Young tableaux of size n; the ballot sequences are obtained as a length-n vector v where v_k is the (number of the) row in which the number r occurs in the tableaux. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jul 29 2012

Number of factorial numbers of length n-1 with no adjacent nonzero digits. For example the 10 such numbers (in rising factorial radix) of length 3 are 000, 001, 002, 003, 010, 020, 100, 101, 102, and 103. - _Joerg Arndt_, Nov 11 2012

Also called restricted Stirling numbers of the second kind (see Mezo). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 27 2013

a(n) is the number of permutations of [n] that avoid the consecutive patterns 123 and 132. Proof. Write a self-inverse permutation in standard cycle form: smallest entry in each cycle in first position, first entries decreasing. For example, (6,7)(3,4)(2)(1,5) is in standard cycle form. Then erase parentheses. This is a bijection to the permutations that avoid consecutive 123 and 132 patterns. - _David Callan_, Aug 27 2014

Getu (1991) says these numbers are also known as "telephone numbers". - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 23 2015

a(n) is the number of elements x in S_n such that x^2 = e where e is the identity. - _Jianing Song_, Aug 22 2018

a(n) is the number of congruence orbits of upper-triangular n X n matrices on skew-symmetric matrices, or the number of Borel orbits in largest sect of the type DIII symmetric space SO_{2n}(C)/GL_n(C). Involutions can also be thought of as fixed-point-free partial involutions. See [Bingham and Ugurlu] link. - _Aram Bingham_, Feb 08 2020

From _Thomas Anton_, Apr 20 2020: (Start)

Apparently a(n) = b*c where b is odd iff a(n+b) (when a(n) is defined) is divisible by b.

Apparently a(n) = 2^(f(n mod 4)+floor(n/4))*q where f:{0,1,2,3}->{0,1,2} is given by f(0),f(1)=0, f(2)=1 and f(3)=2 and q is odd. (End)

From _Iosif Pinelis_, Mar 12 2021: (Start)

a(n) is the n-th initial moment of the normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 1. This follows because the moment generating function of that distribution is the e.g.f. of the sequence of the a(n)'s.

The recurrence a(n) = a(n-1) + (n-1)*a(n-2) also follows, by writing E(Z+1)^n=EZ(Z+1)^(n-1)+E(Z+1)^(n-1), where Z is a standard normal random variable, and then taking the first of the latter two integrals by parts. (End)
