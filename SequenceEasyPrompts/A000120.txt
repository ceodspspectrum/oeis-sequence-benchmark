Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: 1's-counting sequence: number of 1's in binary expansion of n (or the binary weight of n).
Comments: The binary weight of n is also called Hamming weight of n. [The term "Hamming weight" was named after the American mathematician Richard Wesley Hamming (1915-1998). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 16 2021]

a(n) is also the largest integer such that 2^a(n) divides binomial(2n, n) = A000984(n). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Mar 27 2002

To construct the sequence, start with 0 and use the rule: If k >= 0 and a(0), a(1), ..., a(2^k-1) are the first 2^k terms, then the next 2^k terms are a(0) + 1, a(1) + 1, ..., a(2^k-1) + 1. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Jan 30 2003

An example of a fractal sequence. That is, if you omit every other number in the sequence, you get the original sequence. And of course this can be repeated. So if you form the sequence a(0 * 2^n), a(1 * 2^n), a(2 * 2^n), a(3 * 2^n), ... (for any integer n > 0), you get the original sequence. - Christopher.Hills(AT)sepura.co.uk, May 14 2003

The n-th row of Pascal's triangle has 2^k distinct odd binomial coefficients where k = a(n) - 1. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, May 15 2003

Fixed point of the morphism 0 -> 01, 1 -> 12, 2 -> 23, 3 -> 34, 4 -> 45, etc., starting from a(0) = 0. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jan 24 2006

a(n) is the number of times n appears among the mystery calculator sequences: A005408, A042964, A047566, A115419, A115420, A115421. - _Jeremy Gardiner_, Jan 25 2006

a(n) is the number of solutions of the Diophantine equation 2^m*k + 2^(m-1) + i = n, where m >= 1, k >= 0, 0 <= i < 2^(m-1); a(5) = 2 because only (m, k, i) = (1, 2, 0) [2^1*2 + 2^0 + 0 = 5] and (m, k, i) = (3, 0, 1) [2^3*0 + 2^2 + 1 = 5] are solutions. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Jan 31 2006

The first appearance of k, k >= 0, is at a(2^k-1). - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jul 27 2006

Sequence is given by T^(infinity)(0) where T is the operator transforming any word w = w(1)w(2)...w(m) into T(w) = w(1)(w(1)+1)w(2)(w(2)+1)...w(m)(w(m)+1). I.e., T(0) = 01, T(01) = 0112, T(0112) = 01121223. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Mar 04 2009

For n >= 2, the minimal k for which a(k(2^n-1)) is not multiple of n is 2^n + 3. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jun 05 2009

Triangle inequality: a(k+m) <= a(k) + a(m). Equality holds if and only if C(k+m, m) is odd. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jul 19 2009

a(k*m) <= a(k) * a(m). - _Robert Israel_, Sep 03 2023

The number of occurrences of value k in the first 2^n terms of the sequence is equal to binomial(n, k), and also equal to the sum of the first n - k + 1 terms of column k in the array A071919. Example with k = 2, n = 7: there are 21 = binomial(7,2) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 2's in a(0) to a(2^7-1). - Brent Spillner (spillner(AT)acm.org), Sep 01 2010, simplified by _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 13 2017

Let m be the number of parts in the listing of the compositions of n as lists of parts in lexicographic order, a(k) = n - length(composition(k)) for all k < 2^n and all n (see example); A007895 gives the equivalent for compositions into odd parts. - _Joerg Arndt_, Nov 09 2012

From _Daniel Forgues_, Mar 13 2015: (Start)

Just tally up row k (binary weight equal k) from 0 to 2^n - 1 to get the binomial coefficient C(n,k). (See A007318.)

     0   1       3               7                              15

  0: O | . | .   . | .   .   .   . | .   .   .   .   .   .   .   . |

  1:   | O | O   . | O   .   .   . | O   .   .   .   .   .   .   . |

  2:   |   |     O |     O   O   . |     O   O   .   O   .   .   . |

  3:   |   |       |             O |             O       O   O   . |

  4:   |   |       |               |                             O |

Due to its fractal nature, the sequence is quite interesting to listen to.

The binary weight of n is a particular case of the digit sum (base b) of n. - _Daniel Forgues_, Mar 13 2015

The mean of the first n terms is 1 less than the mean of [a(n+1),...,a(2n)], which is also the mean of [a(n+2),...,a(2n+1)]. - _Christian Perfect_, Apr 02 2015

a(n) is also the largest part of the integer partition having viabin number n. The viabin number of an integer partition is defined in the following way. Consider the southeast border of the Ferrers board of the integer partition and consider the binary number obtained by replacing each east step with 1 and each north step, except the last one, with 0. The corresponding decimal form is, by definition, the viabin number of the given integer partition. "Viabin" is coined from "via binary". For example, consider the integer partition [2, 2, 2, 1]. The southeast border of its Ferrers board yields 10100, leading to the viabin number 20. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 20 2017

a(n) is also known as the population count of the binary representation of n. - _Chai Wah Wu_, May 19 2020
