Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Superfactorials: product of first n factorials.
Comments: a(n) is also the Vandermonde determinant of the numbers 1,2,...,(n+1), i.e., the determinant of the (n+1) X (n+1) matrix A with A[i,j] = i^j, 1 <= i <= n+1, 0 <= j <= n. - Ahmed Fares (ahmedfares(AT)my-deja.com), May 06 2001

a(n) = (1/n!) * D(n) where D(n) is the determinant of order n in which the (i,j)-th element is i^j. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Jan 02 2002

Determinant of S_n where S_n is the n X n matrix S_n(i,j) = Sum_{d|i} d^j. - _Benoit Cloitre_, May 19 2002

Appears to be det(M_n) where M_n is the n X n matrix with m(i,j) = J_j(i) where J_k(n) denote the Jordan function of row k, column n (cf. A059380(m)). - _Benoit Cloitre_, May 19 2002

Determinant of the (n+1) X (n+1) matrix whose i-th row consists of terms 1 to n+1 of the Lucas sequence U(i,Q), for any Q. When Q=0, the Vandermonde matrix is obtained. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 21 2004

Determinant of the (n+1) X (n+1) matrix A whose elements are A(i,j) = B(i+j) for 0 <= i,j <= n, where B(k) is the k-th Bell number, A000110(k) [I. Mezo, JIS 14 (2011) # 11.1.1]. - _T. D. Noe_, Dec 04 2004

The Hankel transform of the sequence A090365 is A000178(n+1); example: det([1,1,3; 1,3,11; 3,11,47]) = 12. - _Philippe Deléham_, Mar 02 2005

Theorem 1.3, page 2, of Polynomial points, Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol. 10 (2007), Article 07.3.6, provides an example of an Abelian quotient group of order (n-1) superfactorial, for each positive integer n. The quotient is obtained from sequences of polynomial values. - E. F. Cornelius, Jr. (efcornelius(AT)comcast.net), Apr 09 2007

Starting with offset 1 this is a 'Matryoshka doll' sequence with alpha=1, the multiplicative counterpart to the additive A000292. seq(mul(mul(i,i=alpha..k), k=alpha..n),n=alpha..12). - _Peter Luschny_, Jul 14 2009

For n>0, a(n) is also the determinant of S_n where S_n is the n X n matrix, indexed from 1, S_n(i,j)=sigma_i(j), where sigma_k(n) is the generalized divisor sigma function: A000203 is sigma_1(n). - _Enrique Pérez Herrero_, Jun 21 2010

a(n) is the multiplicative Wiener index of the (n+1)-vertex path. Example: a(4)=288 because in the path on 5 vertices there are 3 distances equal to 2, 2 distances equal to 3, and 1 distance equal to 4 (2*2*2*3*3*4=288). See p. 115 of the Gutman et al. reference. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Sep 21 2011

a(n-1) = Product_{j=1..n-1} j! = V(n) = Product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (j - i) (a Vandermondian V(n), see the Ahmed Fares May 06 2001 comment above), n >= 1, is in fact the determinant of any n X n matrix M(n) with entries M(n;i,j) = p(j-1,x = i), 1 <= i, j <= n, where p(m,x), m >= 0, are monic polynomials of exact degree m with p(0,x) = 1. This is a special x[i] = i choice in a general theorem given in Vein-Dale, p. 59 (written for the transposed matrix M(n;j,x_i) = p(i-1,x_j) = P_i(x_j) in Vein-Dale, and there a_{k,k} = 1, for k=1..n). See the Aug 26 2013 comment under A049310, where p(n,x) = S(n,x) (Chebyshev S). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 27 2013

a(n) is the number of monotonic magmas on n elements labeled 1..n with a symmetric multiplication table. I.e., Product(i,j) >= max(i,j); Product(i,j) = Product(j,i). - _Chad Brewbaker_, Nov 03 2013

The product of the pairwise differences of n+1 integers is a multiple of a(n) [and this does not hold for any k > a(n)]. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 15 2014

a(n) is the determinant of the (n+1) X (n+1) matrix M with M(i,j) = (n+j-1)!/(n+j-i)!, 1 <= i <= n+1, 1 <= j <= n+1. - _Stoyan Apostolov_, Aug 26 2014

Empirical: a(n-1) is the determinant of order n in which the (i,j)-th entry is the (j-1)-th derivative of x^(x+i-1) evaluated at x=1. - _John M. Campbell_, Dec 13 2016

Empirical: If f(x) is a smooth, real-valued function on an open neighborhood of 0 such that f(0)=1, then a(n) is the determinant of order n+1 in which the (i,j)-th entry is the (j-1)-th derivative of f(x)/((1-x)^(i-1)) evaluated at x=0. - _John M. Campbell_, Dec 27 2016

Also the automorphism group order of the n-triangular honeycomb rook graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Jul 14 2017

Is the zigzag Hankel transform of A000182. That is, a(2*n+1) is the Hankel transform of A000182 and a(2*n+2) is the Hankel transform of A000182(n+1). - _Michael Somos_, Mar 11 2020

Except for n = 0, 1, superfactorial a(n) is never a square (proof in link Mabry and Cormick, FFF 4 p. 349); however, when k belongs to A349079 (see for further information), there exists m, 1 <= m <= k such that a(k) / m! is a square. - _Bernard Schott_, Nov 29 2021
