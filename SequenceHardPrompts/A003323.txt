Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Multicolor Ramsey numbers R(3,3,...,3), where there are n 3's.
Comments: Definition: if the edges of a complete graph with at least a(n) nodes are colored with n colors then there is always a monochromatic triangle, and a(n) is the smallest number with this property.

Has it been proved that a(4)=62, or is it just an upper bound? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 12 2016

62 is an upper bound.  It is probably not the correct value, which is likely closer to the lower bound of 51. - _Jeremy F. Alm_, Jun 12 2016

From _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, Jul 23 2021: (Start)

According to the survey by Radziszowski, the following are the best known bounds:

    51 <= a(4) <=    62,

   162 <= a(5) <=   307,

   538 <= a(6) <=  1838,

  1682 <= a(7) <= 12861.

(End)

In general, if a(n)=r then a(n+1) <= n*(r-1) + r + 1 = (n+1)*(r-1) + 2. - _Roderick MacPhee_, Mar 03 2023
