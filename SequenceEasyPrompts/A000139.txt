Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = 2*(3*n)! / ((2*n+1)!*(n+1)!).
Comments: This sequence arises in many different contexts, and over the years it has had several different definitions. I have now changed the definition back to one of the earlier ones, a self-contained formula. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 24 2012

The number of 2-stack sortable permutations on n letters (n >= 1).

The number of rooted non-separable planar maps with n+1 edges. - _Valery A. Liskovets_, Mar 17 2005

The shifted sequence starting with a(1): Number of quadrangular dissections of a square, counted by the number of vertices. Rooted, non-separable planar maps with no multiple edges, in which each non-root face has degree 4.

Number of left ternary trees having n nodes (n>=1). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 23 2006

A combinatorial interpretation for this sequence in terms of a family of plane trees is given in [Schaeffer, Corollary 2 with k = 3]. - _Peter Bala_, Oct 12 2011

Number of canopy intervals in the Tamari lattices, see [PrÃ©ville-Ratelle and Viennot, section 6]. - _F. Chapoton_, Apr 19 2015

The number of fighting fish (branching polyominoes). - _David Bevan_, Jan 10 2018

The number of 1324-avoiding dominoes (gridded permutations). - _David Bevan_, Jan 10 2018

For n > 0, a(n) is the number of simple strong triangulations of a fixed quadrilateral with n interior nodes. See A210664. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Feb 24 2021
