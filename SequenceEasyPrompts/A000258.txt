Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Expansion of e.g.f. exp(exp(exp(x)-1)-1).
Comments: Number of 3-level labeled rooted trees with n leaves. - _Christian G. Bower_, Aug 15 1998

Number of pairs of set partitions (d,d') of [n] such that d is finer than d'. - A. Joseph Kennedy (kennedy_2001in(AT)yahoo.co.in), Feb 05 2006

In the Comm. Algebra paper cited, I introduce a sequence of algebras called 'class partition algebras' with this sequence as dimensions. The algebras are the centralizers of wreath product in combinatorial representation theory. - A. Joseph Kennedy (kennedy_2001in(AT)yahoo.co.in), Feb 17 2008

a(n) is the number of ways to partition {1,2,...,n} and then partition each cell (block) into subcells.
