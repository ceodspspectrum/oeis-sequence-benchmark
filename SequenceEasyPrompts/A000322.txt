Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Pentanacci numbers: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-3) + a(n-4) + a(n-5) with a(0) = a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = a(4) = 1.
Comments: For n>=0: a(n+2) is the number of length-n words with letters {0,1,2,3,4} where the letter x is followed by at least x zeros, see fxtbook link below. - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 08 2011
