Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Absolute primes (or permutable primes): every permutation of the digits is a prime.
Comments: From _Bill Gosper_, Jan 24 2003, in a posting to the Math Fun Mailing List: (Start)

Recall Sloane's old request for more terms of A003459 = (2 3 5 7 11 13 17 31 37 71 73 79 97 113 131 199 311 337 373 733 919 991 ...) and Richard C. Schroeppel's astonishing observation that the next term is 1111111111111111111. Absent Rich's analysis, trying to extend this sequence makes a great set of beginner's programming exercises. We may restrict the search to combinations of the four digits 1,3,7,9, only look at starting numbers with nondecreasing digits, generate only unique digit combinations, and only as needed. (We get the target sequence afterward by generating and merging the various permutations, and fudging the initial 2,3,5,7.)

To my amazement the (uncompiled, Macsyma) program printed 11,13,...,199,337, and after about a minute, 1111111111111111111!

And after a few more minutes, (10^23-1)/9! (End)

Boal and Bevis say that Johnson (1977) proves that if there is a term > 1000 with exactly two distinct digits then it must have more than nine billion digits. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 06 2015

Some authors require permutable or absolute primes to have at least two different digits. This produces the subsequence A129338. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 26 2008

See A039986 for a related problem with more sophisticated (PARI) code (iteration over only inequivalent digit permutations). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 10 2018
