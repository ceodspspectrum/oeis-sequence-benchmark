Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Powers of 2: a(n) = 2^n.
Comments: 2^0 = 1 is the only odd power of 2.

Number of subsets of an n-set.

There are 2^(n-1) compositions (ordered partitions) of n (see for example Riordan). This is the unlabeled analog of the preferential labelings sequence A000670.

This is also the number of weakly unimodal permutations of 1..n + 1, that is, permutations with exactly one local maximum. E.g., a(4) = 16: 12345, 12354, 12453, 12543, 13452, 13542, 14532 and 15432 and their reversals. - _Jon Perry_, Jul 27 2003 [Proof: see next line! See also A087783.]

Proof: n must appear somewhere and there are 2^(n-1) possible choices for the subset that precedes it. These must appear in increasing order and the rest must follow n in decreasing order. QED. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 26 2003

a(n+1) is the smallest number that is not the sum of any number of (distinct) earlier terms.

Same as Pisot sequences E(1, 2), L(1, 2), P(1, 2), T(1, 2). See A008776 for definitions of Pisot sequences.

With initial 1 omitted, same as Pisot sequences E(2, 4), L(2, 4), P(2, 4), T(2, 4). - _David W. Wilson_

Not the sum of two or more consecutive numbers. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, May 14 2004

Least deficient or near-perfect numbers (i.e., n such that sigma(n) = A000203(n) = 2n - 1). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Jun 03 2004. [Comment from _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 26 2005: All the powers of 2 are least deficient numbers but it is not known if there exists a least deficient number that is not a power of 2.]

Almost-perfect numbers referred to as least deficient or slightly defective (Singh 1997) numbers. Does "near-perfect numbers" refer to both almost-perfect numbers (sigma(n) = 2n - 1) and quasi-perfect numbers (sigma(n) = 2n + 1)? There are no known quasi-perfect or least abundant or slightly excessive (Singh 1997) numbers.

The sum of the numbers in the n-th row of Pascal's triangle; the sum of the coefficients of x in the expansion of (x+1)^n.

The Collatz conjecture (the hailstone sequence will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially) may be restated as (the hailstone sequence will eventually reach a power of 2, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially).

The only hailstone sequence which doesn't rebound (except "on the ground"). - _Alexandre Wajnberg_, Jan 29 2005

With p(n) as the number of integer partitions of n, p(i) is the number of parts of the i-th partition of n, d(i) is the number of different parts of the i-th partition of n, m(i,j) is the multiplicity of the j-th part of the i-th partition of n, one has: a(n) = Sum_{i = 1..p(n)} (p(i)! / (Product_{j=1..d(i)} m(i,j)!)). - _Thomas Wieder_, May 18 2005

The number of binary relations on an n-element set that are both symmetric and antisymmetric. Also the number of binary relations on an n-element set that are symmetric, antisymmetric and transitive.

The first differences are the sequence itself. - _Alexandre Wajnberg_ and _Eric Angelini_, Sep 07 2005

Let P(A) be the power set of an n-element set A. Then a(n) is the number of pairs of elements {x,y} of P(A) for which x = y. - _Ross La Haye_, Jan 09 2008

a(n) is the number of different ways to run up a staircase with n steps, taking steps of sizes 1, 2, 3, ... and r (r <= n), where the order IS important and there is no restriction on the number or the size of each step taken. - _Mohammad K. Azarian_, May 21 2008

a(n) is the number of permutations on [n+1] such that every initial segment is an interval of integers. Example: a(3) counts 1234, 2134, 2314, 2341, 3214, 3241, 3421, 4321. The map "p -> ascents of p" is a bijection from these permutations to subsets of [n]. An ascent of a permutation p is a position i such that p(i) < p(i+1). The permutations shown map to 123, 23, 13, 12, 3, 2, 1 and the empty set respectively. - _David Callan_, Jul 25 2008

2^(n-1) is the largest number having n divisors (in the sense of A077569); A005179(n) is the smallest. - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 02 2008

A classical transform consists (for general a(n)) in swapping a(2n) and a(2n+1); examples for Jacobsthal A001045 and successive differences: A092808, A094359, A140505. a(n) = A000079 leads to 2, 1, 8, 4, 32, 16, ... = A135520. - _Paul Curtz_, Jan 05 2009

This is also the (L)-sieve transform of {2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 2n, ...} = A005843. (See A152009 for the definition of the (L)-sieve transform.) - _John W. Layman_, Jan 23 2009

Permutations of n+1 elements where no element is more than one position right of its original place. For example, there are 4 such permutations of three elements: 123, 132, 213, and 312. The 8 such permutations of four elements are 1234, 1243, 1324, 1423, 2134, 2143, 3124, and 4123. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jun 24 2009

Or, phi(n) is equal to the number of perfect partitions of n. - _Juri-Stepan Gerasimov_, Oct 10 2009

These are the 2-smooth numbers, positive integers with no prime factors greater than 2. - _Michael B. Porter_, Oct 04 2009

A064614(a(n)) = A000244(n) and A064614(m) < A000244(n) for m < a(n). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Feb 08 2010

a(n) is the largest number m such that the number of steps of iterations of {r - (largest divisor d < r)} needed to reach 1 starting at r = m is equal to n. Example (a(5) = 32): 32 - 16 = 16; 16 - 8 = 8; 8 - 4 = 4; 4 - 2 = 2; 2 - 1 = 1; number 32 has 5 steps and is the largest such number. See A105017, A064097, A175125. - _Jaroslav Krizek_, Feb 15 2010

The mini-sequence b(n) = least number k > 0 such that 2^k ends in n identical digits is given by {1, 18, 39}. The repeating digits are {2, 4, 8} respectively. Note that these are consecutive powers of 2 (2^1, 2^2, 2^3), and these are the only powers of 2 (2^k, k > 0) that are only one digit. Further, this sequence is finite. The number of n-digit endings for a power of 2 with n or more digits id 4*5^(n-1). Thus, for b(4) to exist, one only needs to check exponents up to 4*5^3 = 500. Since b(4) does not exist, it is clear that no other number will exist. - _Derek Orr_, Jun 14 2014

The least number k > 0 such that 2^k ends in n consecutive decreasing digits is a 3-number sequence given by {1, 5, 25}. The consecutive decreasing digits are {2, 32, 432}. There are 100 different 3-digit endings for 2^k. There are no k-values such that 2^k ends in '987', '876', '765', '654', '543', '321', or '210'. The k-values for which 2^k ends in '432' are given by 25 mod 100. For k = 25 + 100*x, the digit immediately before the run of '432' is {4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, ...} for x = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}, respectively. Thus, we see the digit before '432' will never be a 5. So, this sequence is complete. - _Derek Orr_, Jul 03 2014

a(n) is the number of permutations of length n avoiding both 231 and 321 in the classical sense which are breadth-first search reading words of increasing unary-binary trees. For more details, see the entry for permutations avoiding 231 at A245898. - _Manda Riehl_, Aug 05 2014

Number of monotone maps f : [0..n] -> [0..n] which are order-increasing (i <= f(i)) and idempotent (f(f(i)) = f(i)). In other words, monads on the n-th ordinal (seen as a posetal category). Any monad f determines a subset of [0..n] that contains n, by considering its set of monad algebras = fixed points { i | f(i) = i }. Conversely, any subset S of [0..n] containing n determines a monad on [0..n], by the function i |-> min { j | i <= j, j in S }. - _Noam Zeilberger_, Dec 11 2016

Consider n points lying on a circle. Then for n>=2 a(n-2) gives the number of ways to connect two adjacent points with nonintersecting chords. - _Anton Zakharov_, Dec 31 2016
