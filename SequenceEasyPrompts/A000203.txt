Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: a(n) = sigma(n), the sum of the divisors of n. Also called sigma_1(n).
Comments: Multiplicative: If the canonical factorization of n into prime powers is the product of p^e(p) then sigma_k(n) = Product_p ((p^((e(p)+1)*k))-1)/(p^k-1).

Sum_{d|n} 1/d^k is equal to sigma_k(n)/n^k. So sequences A017665-A017712 also give the numerators and denominators of sigma_k(n)/n^k for k = 1..24. The power sums sigma_k(n) are in sequences A000203 (this sequence) (k=1), A001157-A001160 (k=2,3,4,5), A013954-A013972 for k = 6,7,...,24. - Ahmed Fares (ahmedfares(AT)my-deja.com), Apr 05 2001

A number n is abundant if sigma(n) > 2n (cf. A005101), perfect if sigma(n) = 2n (cf. A000396), deficient if sigma(n) < 2n (cf. A005100).

a(n) is the number of sublattices of index n in a generic 2-dimensional lattice. - Avi Peretz (njk(AT)netvision.net.il), Jan 29 2001 [In the language of group theory, a(n) is the number of index-n subgroups of Z x Z. - _Jianing Song_, Nov 05 2022]

The sublattices of index n are in one-to-one correspondence with matrices [a b; 0 d] with a>0, ad=n, b in [0..d-1]. The number of these is Sum_{d|n} d = sigma(n), which is a(n). A sublattice is primitive if gcd(a,b,d) = 1; the number of these is n * Product_{p|n} (1+1/p), which is A001615. [Cf. Grady reference.]

Sum of number of common divisors of n and m, where m runs from 1 to n. - _Naohiro Nomoto_, Jan 10 2004

a(n) is the cardinality of all extensions over Q_p with degree n in the algebraic closure of Q_p, where p>n. - Volker Schmitt (clamsi(AT)gmx.net), Nov 24 2004. Cf. A100976, A100977, A100978 (p-adic extensions).

Let s(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - a(n-5) - a(n-7) + a(n-12) + a(n-15) - a(n-22) - a(n-26) + ..., then a(n) = s(n) if n is not pentagonal, i.e., n != (3 j^2 +- j)/2 (cf. A001318), and a(n) is instead s(n) - ((-1)^j)*n if n is pentagonal. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 05 2008 [corrected Apr 27 2012 by _William J. Keith_ based on Ewell and by _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Apr 08 2022]

Write n as 2^k * d, where d is odd. Then a(n) is odd if and only if d is a square. - _Jon Perry_, Nov 08 2012

Also total number of parts in the partitions of n into equal parts. - _Omar E. Pol_, Jan 16 2013

Note that sigma(3^4) = 11^2. On the other hand, Kanold (1947) shows that the equation sigma(q^(p-1)) = b^p has no solutions b > 2, q prime, p odd prime. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 21 2013, based on postings to the Number Theory Mailing List by _Vladimir Letsko_ and _Luis H. Gallardo_

Limit_{m->infinity} (Sum_{n=1..prime(m)} a(n)) / prime(m)^2 = zeta(2)/2 = Pi^2/12 (A072691). See more at A244583. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Jan 04 2015

a(n) + A000005(n) is an odd number iff n = 2m^2, m>=1. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Jan 15 2015

a(n) = a(n+1) for n = 14, 206, 957, 1334, 1364 (A002961). - _Zak Seidov_, May 03 2016

Also the total number of horizontal rhombuses in the terraces of the n-th level of an irregular stepped pyramid (starting from the top) whose structure arises after the k-degree-zig-zag folding of every row of the diagram of the isosceles triangle A237593, where k is an angle greater than zero and less than 180 degrees. - _Omar E. Pol_, Jul 05 2016

Equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis: a(n) < H(n) + exp(H(n))*log(H(n)), for all n>1, where H(n) is the n-th harmonic number (Jeffrey Lagarias). See A057641 for more details. - _Ilya Gutkovskiy_, Jul 05 2016

a(n) is the total number of even parts in the partitions of 2*n into equal parts. More generally, a(n) is the total number of parts congruent to 0 mod k in the partitions of k*n into equal parts (the comment dated Jan 16 2013 is the case for k = 1). - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 18 2019

From _Jianing Song_, Nov 05 2022: (Start)

a(n) is also the number of order-n subgroups of C_n X C_n, where C_n is the cyclic group of order n. Proof: by the correspondence theorem in the group theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the order-n subgroups of C_n X C_n = (Z x Z)/(nZ x nZ) and the index-n subgroups of Z x Z containing nZ x nZ. But an index-n normal subgroup of a (multiplicative) group G contains {g^n : n in G} automaticly. The desired result follows from the comment from _Naohiro Nomoto_ above.

The number of subgroups of C_n X C_n that are isomorphic to C_n is A001615(n). (End)
