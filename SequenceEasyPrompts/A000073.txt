Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Tribonacci numbers: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-3) for n >= 3 with a(0) = a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1.
Comments: The name "tribonacci number" is less well-defined than "Fibonacci number". The sequence A000073 (which begins 0, 0, 1) is probably the most important version, but the name has also been applied to A000213, A001590, and A081172. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 25 2024

Also (for n > 1) number of ordered trees with n+1 edges and having all leaves at level three. Example: a(4)=2 because we have two ordered trees with 5 edges and having all leaves at level three: (i) one edge emanating from the root, at the end of which two paths of length two are hanging and (ii) one path of length two emanating from the root, at the end of which three edges are hanging. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jan 03 2004

a(n) is the number of compositions of n-2 with no part greater than 3. Example: a(5)=4 because we have 1+1+1 = 1+2 = 2+1 = 3. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Mar 10 2004

Let A denote the 3 X 3 matrix [0,0,1;1,1,1;0,1,0]. a(n) corresponds to both the (1,2) and (3,1) entries in A^n. - _Paul Barry_, Oct 15 2004

Number of permutations satisfying -k <= p(i)-i <= r, i=1..n-2, with k=1, r=2. - _Vladimir Baltic_, Jan 17 2005

Number of binary sequences of length n-3 that have no three consecutive 0's. Example: a(7)=13 because among the 16 binary sequences of length 4 only 0000, 0001 and 1000 have 3 consecutive 0's. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Apr 27 2006

Therefore, the complementary sequence to A050231 (n coin tosses with a run of three heads). a(n) = 2^(n-3) - A050231(n-3) - _Toby Gottfried_, Nov 21 2010

Convolved with the Padovan sequence = row sums of triangle A153462. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Dec 27 2008

For n > 1: row sums of the triangle in A157897. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jun 25 2009

a(n+2) is the top left entry of the n-th power of any of the 3 X 3 matrices [1, 1, 1; 0, 0, 1; 1, 0, 0] or [1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1; 1, 0, 0] or [1, 1, 1; 1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 1; 1, 0, 0; 1, 1, 0]. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 03 2014

a(n-1) is the top left entry of the n-th power of any of the 3 X 3 matrices [0, 0, 1; 1, 1, 1; 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0; 0, 1, 1; 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1; 1, 0, 1; 0, 1, 1] or [0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1; 1, 1, 1]. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 03 2014

Also row sums of A082601 and of A082870. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Apr 13 2014

Least significant bits are given in A021913 (a(n) mod 2 = A021913(n)). - _Andres Cicuttin_, Apr 04 2016

The nonnegative powers of the tribonacci constant t = A058265 are t^n = a(n)*t^2 + (a(n-1) + a(n-2))*t + a(n-1)*1, for  n >= 0, with  a(-1) = 1 and a(-2) = -1. This follows from the recurrences derived from t^3 = t^2 + t + 1. See the example in A058265 for the first nonnegative powers. For the negative powers see A319200. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 23 2018

The term "tribonacci number" was coined by Mark Feinberg (1963), a 14-year-old student in the 9th grade of the Susquehanna Township Junior High School in Pennsylvania. He died in 1967 in a motorcycle accident. - _Amiram Eldar_, Apr 16 2021

Andrews, Just, and Simay (2021, 2022) remark that it has been suggested that this sequence is mentioned in Charles Darwin's Origin of Species as bearing the same relation to elephant populations as the Fibonacci numbers do to rabbit populations. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 12 2022
