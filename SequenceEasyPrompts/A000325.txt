Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: a(n) = 2^n - n.
Comments: Number of permutations of degree n with at most one fall; called "Grassmannian permutations" by Lascoux and Schützenberger. - Axel Kohnert (Axel.Kohnert(AT)uni-bayreuth.de)

Number of different permutations of a deck of n cards that can be produced by a single shuffle. [DeSario]

Number of Dyck paths of semilength n having at most one long ascent (i.e., ascent of length at least two). Example: a(4)=12 because among the 14 Dyck paths of semilength 4, the only paths that have more than one long ascent are UUDDUUDD and UUDUUDDD (each with two long ascents). Here U = (1, 1) and D = (1, -1). Also number of ordered trees with n edges having at most one branch node (i.e., vertex of outdegree at least two). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Feb 22 2004

Number of {12,1*2*,21*}-avoiding signed permutations in the hyperoctahedral group.

Number of 1342-avoiding circular permutations on [n+1].

2^n - n is the number of ways to partition {1, 2, ..., n} into arithmetic progressions, where in each partition all the progressions have the same common difference and have lengths at least 1. - Marty Getz (ffmpg1(AT)uaf.edu) and Dixon Jones (fndjj(AT)uaf.edu), May 21 2005

if b(0) = x and b(n) = b(n-1) + b(n-1)^2*x^(n-2) for n > 0, then b(n) is a polynomial of degree a(n). - _Michael Somos_, Nov 04 2006

The chromatic invariant of the Mobius ladder graph M_n for n >= 2. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Aug 29 2008

Dimension sequence of the dual alternative operad (i.e., associative and satisfying the identity xyz + yxz + zxy + xzy + yzx + zyx = 0) over the field of characteristic 3. - _Pasha Zusmanovich_, Jun 09 2009

An elephant sequence, see A175654. For the corner squares six A[5] vectors, with decimal values between 26 and 176, lead to this sequence (without the first leading 1). For the central square these vectors lead to the companion sequence A168604. - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Aug 15 2010

a(n+1) is also the number of order-preserving and order-decreasing partial isometries (of an n-chain). - _Abdullahi Umar_, Jan 13 2011

A040001(n) = p(-1) where p(x) is the unique degree-n polynomial such that p(k) = a(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., n. - _Michael Somos_, May 12 2012

A130103(n+1) = p(n+1) where p(x) is the unique degree-n polynomial such that p(k) = a(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., n. - _Michael Somos_, May 12 2012

The number of labeled graphs with n vertices whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and a set of isolated points. - _Alex J. Best_, Nov 20 2012

For n > 0, a(n) is a B_2 sequence. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Sep 23 2014

See coefficients of the linear terms of the polynomials of the table on p. 10 of the Getzler link. - _Tom Copeland_, Mar 24 2016

Consider n points lying on a circle, then for n>=2 a(n-1) is the maximum number of ways to connect two points with non-intersecting chords. - _Anton Zakharov_, Dec 31 2016

Also the number of cliques in the (n-1)-triangular honeycomb rook graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Jul 14 2017

From _Eric M. Schmidt_, Jul 17 2017: (Start)

Number of sequences (e(1), ..., e(n)), 0 <= e(i) < i, such that there is no triple i < j < k with e(i) != e(j) < e(k). [Martinez and Savage, 2.7]

Number of sequences (e(1), ..., e(n)), 0 <= e(i) < i, such that there is no triple i < j < k with e(i), e(j), e(k) pairwise distinct. [Martinez and Savage, 2.7]

Number of sequences (e(1), ..., e(n)), 0 <= e(i) < i, such that there is no triple i < j < k with e(j) >= e(k) and e(i) != e(k) pairwise distinct. [Martinez and Savage, 2.7]

Number of F-equivalence classes of Łukasiewicz paths. Łukasiewicz paths are F-equivalent iff the positions of pattern F are identical in these paths. -  _Sergey Kirgizov_, Apr 08 2018

From _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 10 2019: (Start)

Also the number of connected partitions of an n-cycle. For example, the a(1) = 1 through a(4) = 12 connected partitions are:

  {{1}}  {{12}}    {{123}}      {{1234}}

         {{1}{2}}  {{1}{23}}    {{1}{234}}

                   {{12}{3}}    {{12}{34}}

                   {{13}{2}}    {{123}{4}}

                   {{1}{2}{3}}  {{124}{3}}
