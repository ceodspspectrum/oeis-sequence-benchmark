Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Number of connected linear spaces with n (unlabeled) points.
Comments: Euler transform is A001200. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 24 2014

In any linear space any two distinct points belong to exactly one line. A linear space is disconnected if there exists a partition of the points of the space into two subsets such that for any two distinct points in a subset of the partition the unique line they both belong to is completely contained in that subset. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 24 2014
