Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Primes and squares of primes.
Comments: Also numbers n such that the product of proper divisors is < n.

See A050216 for lengths of blocks of consecutive primes. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Sep 23 2011

Numbers q > 1 such that d(q) < 4. Numbers k such that the number of ways of writing k = m + t is equal to the number of ways of writing k = r*s, where m|t and r|s. - _Juri-Stepan Gerasimov_, Oct 14 2017

Called multiplicatively deficient numbers by Chau (2004). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 29 2022
