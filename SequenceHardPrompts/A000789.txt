Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Maximal order of a triangle-free cyclic graph with no independent set of size n.
Comments: Previous name was: Ramsey numbers.

The sequence may be considered as consisting of a special kind of Ramsey numbers. It is related to the ordinary two-color Ramsey numbers R(3,n), given in A000791, by the relation a(n) <= A000791(n)-1 as proved by Kalbfleisch. He also calculated the first eight terms, and noted that the inequality sometimes is strict. The first n for which this happens is n=6.

The terms a(10), a(11) and a(12) were calculated by Harborth and Krause. - _JÃ¶rgen Backelin_, Jan 07 2016
