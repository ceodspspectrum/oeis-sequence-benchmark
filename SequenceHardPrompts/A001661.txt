Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Largest number not the sum of distinct positive n-th powers.
Comments: a(8) > 74^8. - _Donovan Johnson_, Nov 23 2010

Fuller and Nichols prove that a(6) = 11146309947 and that 2037573096 positive numbers cannot be written as the sum of distinct 6th powers. - _Robert Nichols_, Sep 09 2017

a(8) >= 83^8 ~ 2.25e15 since A030052(8) = 84. Similarly, a(9..15) >= (46^9, 62^10, 67^11, 80^12, 101^13, 94^14, 103^15) ~ (9.2e14, 8.4e17, 1.2e20, 6.9e22, 1.1e26, 4.2e27, 1.6e30), cf. formula. Most often a(n) will be closer to and even larger than A030052(n)^n. - In the literature, a(n)+1 is known as the anti-Waring number N(n,1). - _M. F. Hasler_, May 15 2020

a(9..16) > (1.55e17, 1.31e19, 1.64e21, 5.55e23, 1.32e26, 1.37e28, 2.09e30, 9.99e35). - _Michael J. Wiener_, Jun 10 2023
