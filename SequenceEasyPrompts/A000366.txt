Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Genocchi numbers of second kind (A005439) divided by 2^(n-1).
Comments: The earliest known reference to these numbers is the Dellac Marseille memoir. - _Don Knuth_, Jul 11 2007

According to Ira Gessel, Dellac's interpretation is the following: start with a 2n X n array of cells and consider the set D of cells in rows i through i+n of column i, for i from 1 to n. Then a(n) is the number of subsets of D containing two cells in each column and one cell in each row.

Barsky proved that for even n>1, a(n) is congruent to 3 mod 4 and for odd n>1, congruent to 2 mod 4. Gessel shows that for even n>5, a(n) is congruent to 4n-1 mod 16 and for odd n>2 that a(n)/2 is congruent to 2-n mod 8.

The entry for A005439 has further information.

The number of sequences (I_1,...,I_{n-1}) consisting of subsets of the set {1,...,n} such that the number of elements in I_k is exactly k and I_k\subset I_{k+1}\cup {k+1}. The Euler characteristics of the degenerate flag varieties of type A. - _Evgeny Feigin_, Dec 15 2011

Kreweras proved that for n>2, a(n) is alternatively congruent to 2 and to 7 mod 36. - _Michel Marcus_, Nov 06 2012
