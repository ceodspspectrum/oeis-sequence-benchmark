Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: The positive integers. Also called the natural numbers, the whole numbers or the counting numbers, but these terms are ambiguous.
Comments: For some authors, the terms "natural numbers" and "counting numbers" include 0, i.e., refer to the nonnegative integers A001477; the term "whole numbers" frequently also designates the whole set of (signed) integers A001057.

a(n) is smallest positive integer which is consistent with sequence being monotonically increasing and satisfying a(a(n)) = n (cf. A007378).

Inverse Euler transform of A000219.

The rectangular array having A000027 as antidiagonals is the dispersion of the complement of the triangular numbers, A000217 (which triangularly form column 1 of this array). The array is also the transpose of A038722. - _Clark Kimberling_, Apr 05 2003

For nonzero x, define f(n) = floor(nx) - floor(n/x). Then f=A000027 if and only if x=tau or x=-tau. - _Clark Kimberling_, Jan 09 2005

Numbers of form (2^i)*k for odd k (i.e., n = A006519(n)*A000265(n)); thus n corresponds uniquely to an ordered pair (i,k) where i=A007814, k=A000265 (with A007814(2n)=A001511(n), A007814(2n+1)=0). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Apr 22 2006

If the offset were changed to 0, we would have the following pattern: a(n)=binomial(n,0) + binomial(n,1) for the present sequence (number of regions in 1-space defined by n points), A000124 (number of regions in 2-space defined by n straight lines), A000125 (number of regions in 3-space defined by n planes), A000127 (number of regions in 4-space defined by n hyperplanes), A006261, A008859, A008860, A008861, A008862 and A008863, where the last six sequences are interpreted analogously and in each "... by n ..." clause an offset of 0 has been assumed, resulting in a(0)=1 for all of them, which corresponds to the case of not cutting with a hyperplane at all and therefore having one region. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006

Define a number of points on a straight line to be in general arrangement when no two points coincide. Then these are the numbers of regions defined by n points in general arrangement on a straight line, when an offset of 0 is assumed. For instance, a(0)=1, since using no point at all leaves one region. The sequence satisfies the recursion a(n) = a(n-1) + 1. This has the following geometrical interpretation: Suppose there are already n-1 points in general arrangement, thus defining the maximal number of regions on a straight line obtainable by n-1 points, and now one more point is added in general arrangement. Then it will coincide with no other point and act as a dividing wall thereby creating one new region in addition to the a(n-1)=(n-1)+1=n regions already there, hence a(n)=a(n-1)+1. Cf. the comments on A000124 for an analogous interpretation. - Peter C. Heinig (algorithms(AT)gmx.de), Oct 19 2006

The sequence a(n)=n (for n=1,2,3) and a(n)=n+1 (for n=4,5,...) gives to the rank (minimal cardinality of a generating set) for the semigroup I_n\S_n, where I_n and S_n denote the symmetric inverse semigroup and symmetric group on [n]. - _James East_, May 03 2007

The sequence a(n)=n (for n=1,2), a(n)=n+1 (for n=3) and a(n)=n+2 (for n=4,5,...) gives the rank (minimal cardinality of a generating set) for the semigroup PT_n\T_n, where PT_n and T_n denote the partial transformation semigroup and transformation semigroup on [n]. - _James East_, May 03 2007

"God made the integers; all else is the work of man." This famous quotation is a translation of "Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk," spoken by Leopold Kronecker in a lecture at the Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung in 1886. Possibly the first publication of the statement is in Heinrich Weber's "Leopold Kronecker," Jahresberichte D.M.V. 2 (1893) 5-31. - _Clark Kimberling_, Jul 07 2007

Binomial transform of A019590, inverse binomial transform of A001792. - _Philippe Del√©ham_, Oct 24 2007

Writing A000027 as N, perhaps the simplest one-to-one correspondence between N X N and N is this: f(m,n) = ((m+n)^2 - m - 3n + 2)/2. Its inverse is given by I(k)=(g,h), where g = k - J(J-1)/2, h = J + 1 - g, J = floor((1 + sqrt(8k - 7))/2). Thus I(1)=(1,1), I(2)=(1,2), I(3)=(2,1) and so on; the mapping I fills the first-quadrant lattice by successive antidiagonals. - _Clark Kimberling_, Sep 11 2008

a(n) is also the mean of the first n odd integers. - _Ian Kent_, Dec 23 2008

Triangle T(k,j) of natural numbers, read by rows, with T(k,j) = binomial(k,2) + j = (k^2-k)/2 + j where 1 <= j <= k. In other words, a(n) = n = binomial(k,2) + j where k is the largest integer such that binomial(k,2) < n and j = n - binomial(k,2). For example, T(4,1)=7, T(4,2)=8, T(4,3)=9, and T(4,4)=10. Note that T(n,n)=A000217(n), the n-th triangular number. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Nov 19 2009

1/n = continued fraction [n]. Let barover[n] = [n,n,n,...] = 1/k. Then k - 1/k = n. Example: [2,2,2,...] = (sqrt(2) - 1) = 1/k, with k = (sqrt(2) + 1). Then 2 = k - 1/k. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jul 15 2010
