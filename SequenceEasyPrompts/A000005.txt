Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: d(n) (also called tau(n) or sigma_0(n)), the number of divisors of n.
Comments: If the canonical factorization of n into prime powers is Product p^e(p) then d(n) = Product (e(p) + 1). More generally, for k > 0, sigma_k(n) = Product_p ((p^((e(p)+1)*k))-1)/(p^k-1) is the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of n.

Number of ways to write n as n = x*y, 1 <= x <= n, 1 <= y <= n. For number of unordered solutions to x*y=n, see A038548.

Note that d(n) is not the number of Pythagorean triangles with radius of the inscribed circle equal to n (that is A078644). For number of primitive Pythagorean triangles having inradius n, see A068068(n).

Number of factors in the factorization of the polynomial x^n-1 over the integers. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 16 2003

Also equal to the number of partitions p of n such that all the parts have the same cardinality, i.e., max(p)=min(p). - _Giovanni Resta_, Feb 06 2006

Equals A127093 as an infinite lower triangular matrix * the harmonic series, [1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...]. - _Gary W. Adamson_, May 10 2007

For odd n, this is the number of partitions of n into consecutive integers. Proof: For n = 1, clearly true. For n = 2k + 1, k >= 1, map each (necessarily odd) divisor to such a partition as follows: For 1 and n, map k + (k+1) and n, respectively. For any remaining divisor d <= sqrt(n), map (n/d - (d-1)/2) + ... + (n/d - 1) + (n/d) + (n/d + 1) + ... + (n/d + (d-1)/2) {i.e., n/d plus (d-1)/2 pairs each summing to 2n/d}. For any remaining divisor d > sqrt(n), map ((d-1)/2 - (n/d - 1)) + ... + ((d-1)/2 - 1) + (d-1)/2 + (d+1)/2 + ((d+1)/2 + 1) + ... + ((d+1)/2 + (n/d - 1)) {i.e., n/d pairs each summing to d}. As all such partitions must be of one of the above forms, the 1-to-1 correspondence and proof is complete. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Apr 20 2008

Number of subgroups of the cyclic group of order n. - _Benoit Jubin_, Apr 29 2008

Equals row sums of triangle A143319. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 07 2008

Equals row sums of triangle A159934, equivalent to generating a(n) by convolving A000005 prefaced with a 1; (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, ...) with the INVERTi transform of A000005, (A159933): (1, 1,-1, 0, -1, 2, ...). Example: a(6) = 4 = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2) dot (2, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1) = (2, -1, 0, -2, 3, 2) = 4. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 26 2009

Number of times n appears in an n X n multiplication table. - _Dominick Cancilla_, Aug 02 2010

Number of k >= 0 such that (k^2 + k*n + k)/(k + 1) is an integer. - _Juri-Stepan Gerasimov_, Oct 25 2015

The only numbers k such that tau(k) >= k/2 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Dec 14 2016

a(n) is also the number of partitions of 2*n into equal parts, minus the number of partitions of 2*n into consecutive parts. - _Omar E. Pol_, May 03 2017

From _Tomohiro Yamada_, Oct 27 2020: (Start)

Let k(n) = log d(n)*log log n/(log 2 * log n), then lim sup k(n) = 1 (Hardy and Wright, Chapter 18, Theorem 317) and k(n) <= k(6983776800) = 1.537939... (the constant A280235) for every n (Nicolas and Robin, 1983).

There exist infinitely many n such that d(n) = d(n+1) (Heath-Brown, 1984). The number of such integers n <= x is at least c*x/(log log x)^3 (Hildebrand, 1987) but at most O(x/sqrt(log log x)) (Erdős, Carl Pomerance and Sárközy, 1987).

Number of 2D grids of n congruent rectangles with two different side lengths, in a rectangle, modulo rotation (cf. A038548 for squares instead of rectangles). Also number of ways to arrange n identical objects in a rectangle (NOT modulo rotation, cf. A038548 for modulo rotation); cf. A007425 and A140773 for the 3D case. - _Manfred Boergens_, Jun 08 2021
