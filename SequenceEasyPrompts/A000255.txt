Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: a(n) = n*a(n-1) + (n-1)*a(n-2), a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1.
Comments: a(n) counts permutations of [1,...,n+1] having no substring [k,k+1]. - _Len Smiley_, Oct 13 2001

Also, for n > 0, determinant of the tridiagonal n X n matrix M such that M(i,i)=i and for i=1..n-1, M(i,i+1)=-1, M(i+1,i)=i. - Mario Catalani (mario.catalani(AT)unito.it), Feb 04 2003

Also, for n > 0, maximal permanent of a nonsingular n X n (0,1)-matrix, which is achieved by the matrix with just n-1 0's, all on main diagonal. [For proof, see next entry.] - _W. Edwin Clark_, Oct 28 2003

Proof from Richard Brualdi and _W. Edwin Clark_, Nov 15 2003: Let n >= 4. Take an n X n (0,1)-matrix A which is nonsingular. It has t >= n-1, 0's, otherwise there will be two rows of all 1's. Let B be the matrix obtained from A by replacing t-(n-1) of A's 0's with 1's. Let D be the matrix with all 1's except for 0's in the first n-1 positions on the diagonal. This matrix is easily seen to be non-singular. Now we have per(A) < = per(B) < = per (D), where the first inequality follows since replacing 0's by 1's cannot decrease the permanent and the second from Corollary 4.4 in the Brualdi et al. reference, which shows that per(D) is the maximum permanent of ANY n X n matrix with n -1 0's. Corollary 4.4 requires n >= 4. a(n) for n < 4 can be computed directly.

With offset 1, permanent of (0,1)-matrix of size n X (n+d) with d=1 and n zeros not on a line. This is a special case of Theorem 2.3 of Seok-Zun Song et al., Extremes of permanents of (0,1)-matrices, pp. 201-202. - _Jaap Spies_, Dec 12 2003

Number of fixed-point-free permutations of n+2 that begin with a 2; e.g., for 1234, we have 2143, 2341, 2413, so a(2)=3. Also number of permutations of 2..n+2 that have no agreements with 1..n+1. E.g., for 123 against permutations of 234, we have 234, 342 and 432. Compare A047920. - _Jon Perry_, Jan 23 2004. [This can be proved by the standard argument establishing that d(n+2) = (n+1)(d(n+1)+d(n)) for derangements A000166 (n+1 choices of where 1 goes, then either 1 is in a transposition, or in a cycle of length at least 3, etc.). - D. G. Rogers, Aug 28 2006]

Stirling transform of A006252(n+1)=[1,1,2,4,14,38,...] is a(n)=[1,3,11,53,309,...]. - _Michael Somos_, Mar 04 2004

a(n+1) is the sequence of numerators of the self-convergents to 1/(e-2); see A096654. - _Clark Kimberling_, Jul 01 2004

Euler's interpretation was "fixedpoint-free permutations beginning with 2" and he listed the terms up to 148329 (although he was blind at the time). - _Don Knuth_, Jan 25 2007

Equals lim_{k->infinity} A153869^k. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 03 2009

Hankel transform is A059332. - _Paul Barry_, Apr 22 2009

This sequence appears in the analysis of Euler's divergent series 1 - 1! + 2! - 3! + 4! ... by Lacroix, see Hardy. For information about this and related divergent series see A163940. - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Oct 16 2009

a(n), n >= 1, enumerates also the ways to distribute n beads, labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and one open cord allowed to have any number of beads. Each beadless necklace as well as the beadless cord contributes a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., a(0):=1*1=1. There are k! possibilities for the cord with k>=0 beads, which means that the two ends of the cord should be considered as fixed, in short: a fixed cord. This produces for a(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the sequences {n!=A000142(n)} and the subfactorials {A000166(n)}.

See the formula below. Alternatively, the e.g.f. for this problem is seen to be (exp(-x)/(1-x))*(1/(1-x)), namely the product of the e.g.f.s for the subfactorials (from the unordered necklace problem, without necklaces with exactly one bead) and the factorials (from the fixed cord problem). Therefore the recurrence with inputs holds also. a(0):=1. This comment derives from a family of recurrences found by Malin Sjodahl for a combinatorial problem for certain quark and gluon diagrams (Feb 27 2010). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 02 2010

a(n) = (n-1)a(n-1) + (n-2)a(n-2) gives the same sequence offset by a 1. - _Jon Perry_, Sep 20 2012

Also, number of reduced 2 X (n+2) Latin rectangles. - _A.H.M. Smeets_, Nov 03 2013

Second column of Euler's difference table (second diagonal in example of A068106). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Dec 13 2016

If we partition the permutations of [n+2] in A000166 according to their starting digit, we will get (n+1) equinumerous classes each of size a(n) (the class starting with the digit 1 is empty since no derangement starts with 1). Hence, A000166(n+2)=(n+1)*a(n), so a(n) is the size of each nonempty class of permutations of [n+2] in A000166. For example, for n=3 we have 44=4*11 (see link). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 11 2017

For n >= 1, the number of circular permutations (in cycle notation) on [n+2] that avoid substrings (j,j+2), 1 <= j <= n.  For example, for n=2, the 3 circular permutations in S4 that avoid substrings {13,24} are (1234),(1423),(1432). Note that each of these circular permutations represent 4 permutations in one-line notation (see link 2017). - _Enrique Navarrete_, Feb 15 2017

The sequence a(n) taken modulo a positive integer k is periodic with exact period dividing k when k is even and dividing 2*k when k is odd. This follows from the congruence a(n+k) = (-1)^k*a(n) (mod k) holding for all n and k, which in turn is easily proved by induction making use of the given recurrences. - _Peter Bala_, Nov 21 2017
