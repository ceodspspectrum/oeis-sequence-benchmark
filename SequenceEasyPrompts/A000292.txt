Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Tetrahedral (or triangular pyramidal) numbers: a(n) = C(n+2,3) = n*(n+1)*(n+2)/6.
Comments: a(n) is the number of balls in a triangular pyramid in which each edge contains n balls.

We consider optimal proper vertex colorings of a graph G. Assume that the labeling, i.e., coloring starts with 1. By optimality we mean that the maximum label used is the minimum of the maximum integer label used across all possible labelings of G. Let S=Sum of the differences |l(v) - l(u)|, the sum being over all edges uv of G and l(w) is the label associated with a vertex w of G. We say G admits unique labeling if all possible labelings of G is S-invariant and yields the same integer partition of S. With an offset this sequence gives the S-values for the complete graph on n vertices, n = 2, 3, ... . - _K.V.Iyer_, Jul 08 2011

Aside from the zero, this sequence is the fourth diagonal of the Pascal matrix A007318 and the only nonvanishing diagonal (fourth) of the matrix representation IM = (A132440)^3/3! of the differential operator D^3/3!, when acting on the row vector of coefficients of an o.g.f., or power series.

The third Euler row (1,4,1) has an additional connection with the tetrahedral numbers besides the n^3 identity stated above: a^2(n) + 4*a^2(n+1) + a^2(n+2) = a(n^2+4n+4), which can be shown with algebra. E.g., a^2(2) + 4*a^2(3) + a^2(4) = 16 + 400 + 400 = a(16). Although an analogous thing happens with the (1,1) row of Euler's triangle and triangular numbers C(n+1,2) = A000217(n) = T(n), namely both T(n-1) + T(n) = n^2 and T^2(n-1) + T^2(n) = T(n^2) are true, only one (the usual identity) still holds for the Euler row (1,11,11,1) and the C(n,4) numbers in A000332.
