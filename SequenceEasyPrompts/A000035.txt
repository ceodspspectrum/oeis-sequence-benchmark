Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Period 2: repeat [0, 1]; a(n) = n mod 2; parity of n.
Comments: Least significant bit of n, lsb(n).

Also decimal expansion of 1/99.

Also the binary expansion of 1/3. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Sep 01 2015

a(n) = A134451(n) mod 2. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Oct 27 2007 [Corrected by _Jianing Song_, Nov 22 2019]

Characteristic function of odd numbers: a(A005408(n)) = 1, a(A005843(n)) = 0. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Sep 29 2008

A102370(n) modulo 2. - _Philippe Deléham_, Apr 04 2009

Base b expansion of 1/(b^2-1) for any b >= 2 is 0.0101... (A005563 has b^2-1). - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Sep 27 2009

Let A be the Hessenberg n X n matrix defined by: A[1,j] = j mod 2, A[i,i] := 1, A[i,i-1] = -1, and A[i,j] = 0 otherwise. Then, for n >= 1, a(n) = (-1)^n*charpoly(A,1). - _Milan Janjic_, Jan 24 2010

From _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 15 2010: (Start)

The sequence is the principal Dirichlet character of the reduced residue system mod 2 or mod 4 or mod 8 or mod 16 ...

Associated Dirichlet L-functions are for example L(2,chi) = Sum_{n>=1} a(n)/n^2 == A111003,

or L(3,chi) = Sum_{n>=1} a(n)/n^3 = 1.05179979... = 7*A002117/8,

or L(4,chi) = Sum_{n>=1} a(n)/n^4 = 1.014678... = A092425/96. (End)

Also parity of the nonnegative integers A001477. - _Omar E. Pol_, Jan 17 2012

a(n) = (4/n), where (k/n) is the Kronecker symbol. See the Eric Weisstein link. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 28 2013

Also the inverse binomial transform of A131577. - _Paul Curtz_, Nov 16 2016 [an observation forwarded by _Jean-François Alcover_]

The emanation sequence for the globe category. That is take the globe category, take the corresponding polynomial comonad, consider its carrier polynomial as a generating function, and take the corresponding sequence. - _David Spivak_, Sep 25 2020

For n > 0, a(n) is the alternating sum of the product of n increasing and n decreasing odd factors. For example, a(4) = 1*7 - 3*5 + 5*3 - 7*1 and a(5) = 1*9 - 3*7 + 5*5 - 7*3 + 9*1. - _Charlie Marion_, Mar 24 2022
