Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + ... + (2*n-1)^2 = n*(4*n^2 - 1)/3.
Comments: 4 times the variance of the area under an n-step random walk: e.g., with three steps, the area can be 9/2, 7/2, 3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2, -7/2, or -9/2 each with probability 1/8, giving a variance of 35/4 or a(3)/4. - _Henry Bottomley_, Jul 14 2003

Number of standard tableaux of shape (2n-1,1,1,1) (n>=1). - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 30 2004

Also a(n) = (1/6)*(8*n^3-2*n), n>0: structured octagonal diamond numbers (vertex structure 9). Cf. A059722 = alternate vertex; A000447 = structured diamonds; and structured tetragonal anti-diamond numbers (vertex structure 9). Cf. A096000 = alternate vertex; A100188 = structured anti-diamonds. Cf. A100145 for more on structured numbers. - James A. Record (james.record(AT)gmail.com), Nov 07 2004

The n-th tetrahedral (or pyramidal) number is n(n+1)(n+2)/6. This sequence contains the tetrahedral numbers of A000292 obtained for n= 1,3,5,7,... (see A015219). - _Valentin Bakoev_, Mar 03 2009

Using three consecutive numbers u, v, w, (u+v+w)^3-(u^3+v^3+w^3) equals 18 times the numbers in this sequence. - _J. M. Bergot_, Aug 24 2011

This sequence is related to A070893 by A070893(2*n-1) = n*a(n)-sum(i=0..n-1, a(i)). - _Bruno Berselli_, Aug 26 2011

Number of integer solutions to 1-n <= x <= y <= z <= n-1. - _Michael Somos_, Dec 27 2011

Partial sums of A016754. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Apr 02 2012

Also the number of cubes in the n-th HaÃ¼y square pyramid. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Sep 27 2017
