Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Set partitions without singletons: number of partitions of an n-set into blocks of size > 1. Also number of cyclically spaced (or feasible) partitions.
Comments: a(n+2) = p(n+1) where p(x) is the unique degree-n polynomial such that p(k) = A000110(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., n. - _Michael Somos_, Oct 07 2003

Number of complete rhyming schemes.

Whereas the Bell number B(n) (A000110(n)) is the number of terms in the polynomial that expresses the n-th moment of a probability distribution as a function of the first n cumulants, these numbers give the number of terms in the corresponding expansion of the _central_ moment as a function of the first n cumulants. - Michael Hardy (hardy(AT)math.umn.edu), Jan 26 2005

a(n) is the number of permutations on [n] for which the left-to-right maxima coincide with the descents (entries followed by a smaller number). For example, a(4) counts 2143, 3142, 3241, 4123. - _David Callan_, Jul 20 2005

From _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 10 2019: (Start)

Also the number of stable partitions of an n-cycle, where a stable partition of a graph is a set partition of the vertex set such that no edge has both ends in the same block. A bijective proof is given in David Callan's article. For example, the a(5) = 11 stable partitions are:

  {{1},{2},{3},{4},{5}}

  {{1},{2},{3,5},{4}}

  {{1},{2,4},{3},{5}}

  {{1},{2,5},{3},{4}}

  {{1,3},{2},{4},{5}}

  {{1,4},{2},{3},{5}}

  {{1},{2,4},{3,5}}

  {{1,3},{2,4},{5}}

  {{1,3},{2,5},{4}}

  {{1,4},{2},{3,5}}

  {{1,4},{2,5},{3}}

(End)

Also number of partitions of {1, 2, ..., n-1} with singletons. E.g., a(4) = 4: {1|2|3, 12|3, 13|2, 1|23}. Also number of cyclical adjacencies partitions of {1, 2, ..., n-1}. E.g., a(4) = 4: {12|3, 13|2, 1|23, 123}. The two partitions can be mapped by a Kreweras bijection. - _Yuchun Ji_, Feb 22 2021

Also the k-th central moment of a Poisson random variable with mean 1. a(n) = E[(X-1)^n, X~Poisson(1)]. - _Thomas Dybdahl Ahle_, Dec 14 2022
