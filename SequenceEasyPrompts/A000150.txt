Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of dissections of an n-gon, rooted at an exterior edge, asymmetric with respect to that edge.
Comments: Number of Dyck paths of length 2n having an odd number of peaks at even height. Example: a(3)=2 because we have UDU(UD)D and U(UD)DUD, where U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and the peaks at even height are shown between parentheses. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Nov 13 2004

For n>=1, a(n) is the number of unordered binary trees with n internal nodes in which the left subtree is distinct from the right subtree. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Feb 21 2013

Assuming offset -1 this is an analog of A275166: pairs of distinct Catalan numbers with index sum n. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 19 2016
