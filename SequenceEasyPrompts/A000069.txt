Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Odious numbers: numbers with an odd number of 1's in their binary expansion.
Comments: This sequence and A001969 give the unique solution to the problem of splitting the nonnegative integers into two classes in such a way that sums of pairs of distinct elements from either class occur with the same multiplicities [Lambek and Moser]. Cf. A000028, A000379.

In French: les nombres impies.

Has asymptotic density 1/2, since exactly 2 of the 4 numbers 4k, 4k+1, 4k+2, 4k+3 have an even sum of bits, while the other 2 have an odd sum. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jun 04 2002

Nim-values for game of mock turtles played with n coins.

A115384(n) = number of odious numbers <= n; A000120(a(n)) = A132680(n). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Aug 26 2007

Indices of 1's in the Thue-Morse sequence A010060. - _Tanya Khovanova_, Dec 29 2008

For any positive integer m, the partition of the set of the first 2^m positive integers into evil ones E and odious ones O is a fair division for any polynomial sequence p(k) of degree less than m, that is, Sum_{k in E} p(k) = Sum_{k in O} p(k) holds for any polynomial p with deg(p) < m. - _Pietro Majer_, Mar 15 2009

For n>1 let b(n) = a(n-1). Then b(b(n)) = 2b(n). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Oct 07 2010

Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers with no term being the binary exclusive OR of any terms. The equivalent sequence for addition or for subtraction is A005408 (the odd numbers) and for multiplication is A026424. - _Peter Munn_, Jan 14 2018

Numbers of the form m XOR (2*m+1) for some m >= 0. - _RÃ©my Sigrist_, Apr 14 2022
