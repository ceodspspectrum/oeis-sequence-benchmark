Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n} p(k) where p(k) = number of partitions of k (A000041).
Comments: Also the total number of all different integers in all partitions of n + 1. E.g., a(3) = 7 because the partitions of 4 comprise the sets {1},{1, 2},{2},{1, 3},{4} of different integers and their total number is 7. - _Thomas Wieder_, Apr 10 2004

With offset 1, also the number of 1's in all partitions of n. For example, 3 = 2+1 = 1+1+1, a(3) = (zero 1's) + (one 1's) + (three 1's), so a(3) = 4. - _Naohiro Nomoto_, Jan 09 2002. See the Riordan reference p. 184, last formula, first term, for a proof based on Fine's identity given in Riordan, p. 182 (20).

Also, number of partitions of n into parts when there are two kinds of parts of size one.

Also number of graphical forest partitions of 2n+2.

a(n) = count 2 for each partition of n and 1 for each decrement. E.g., the partitions of 4 are 4 (2), 31 (3), 22 (2), 211 (3) and 1111 (2). 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12. This is related to the Ferrers representation. We can see that taking the Ferrers diagram for each partition of n and adding a new * to all available columns, we generate each partition of n+1, but with repeats (A058884). - _Jon Perry_, Feb 06 2004

Also the number of 1-transitions among all integer partitions of n. A 1-transition is the removal of a digit "1" from a partition containing at least one "1" and subsequent addition of that "1" to another digit in that partition. This other digit may be a "1" also, but all digits of equal amount are considered as undistinquishable (unlabeled). E.g., for n=6 one has the partition [1113] for which the following two 1-transitions are possible: [1113] --> [123] and [1113] --> [114]. The 1-transitions of n form a partial order (poset). For n=6 one has 12 1-transitions: [111111] --> [11112], [11112] --> [1113], [11112] --> [1122], [1113] --> [114], [1113] --> [123], [1122] --> [123], [1122] --> [222], [123] --> [33], [123] --> [24], [114] --> [15], [114] --> [24], [15] --> [6]. - _Thomas Wieder_, Mar 08 2005

Also number of partitions of 2n+1 where one of the parts is greater than n (also where there are more than n parts) and of 2n+2 where one of the parts is greater than n+1 (or with more than n+1 parts). - _Henry Bottomley_, Aug 01 2005

Equals left border of triangle A137633 - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 31 2008

Equals row sums of triangle A027293. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 26 2008

Convolved with A010815 = [1,1,1,...]. n-th partial sum of A000041 convolved with A010815 = the binomial sequence starting (1, n, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Nov 09 2008

Equals A036469 convolved with A035363. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jun 09 2009

a(A004526(n)) = A025065(n). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jan 23 2010

a(n) = if n <= 1 then A054225(1,n) else A054225(n,1). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Nov 30 2011

Also the total number of 1's among all hook-lengths in all partitions of n. E.g., a(4)=7 because hooks of the partitions of n = 4 comprise the multisets {4,3,2,1}, {4,2,1,1}, {3,2,2,1}, {4,1,2,1}, {4,3,2,1} and their total number of 1's is 7. - _T. Amdeberhan_, Jun 03 2012

With offset 1, a(n) is also the difference between the sum of largest and the sum of second largest elements in all partitions of n. More generally, the number of occurrences of k in all partitions of n equals the difference between the sum of k-th largest and the sum of (k+1)st largest elements in all partitions of n. And more generally, the sum of the number of occurrences of k, k+1, k+2..k+m in all partitions of n equals the difference between the sum of k-th largest and the sum of (k+m+1)st largest elements in all partitions of n. - _Omar E. Pol_, Oct 25 2012

a(0) = 1 and 2*a(n-1) >= a(n) for all n > 0. Hence a(n) is a complete sequence. - _Frank M Jackson_, Apr 08 2013

a(n) is the number of conjugacy classes in the order-preserving, order-decreasing and (order-preserving and order-decreasing) injective transformation semigroups. - _Ugbene Ifeanyichukwu_, Jun 03 2015

a(n) is also the number of unlabeled subgraphs of the n-cycle C_n. For example, for n = 3, there are 3 unlabeled subgraphs of the triangle C_3 with 0 edges, 2 with 1 edge, 1 with 2 edges, and 1 with 3 edges (C_3 itself), so a(3) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7. - _John P. McSorley_, Nov 21 2016

a(n) is also the number of partitions of 2n with all parts either even or equal to 1. Proof: the number of such partitions of 2n with exactly 2k 1's is p(n-k), for k = 0,..,n. Summing over k gives the formula. - _Leonard Chastkofsky_, Jul 24 2018

a(n) is the total number of polygamma functions that appear in the expansion of the (n+1)st derivative of x! with respect to x. More specifically, a(n) is the number of times the string "PolyGamma" appears in the expansion of D[x!, {x, n + 1}] in Mathematica. For example,  D[x!, {x, 3 + 1}] = Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[0, 1 + x]^4 + 6 Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[0, 1 + x]^2 PolyGamma[1, 1 + x] + 3 Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[1, 1 + x]^2 + 4 Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[0, 1 + x] PolyGamma[2, 1 + x] + Gamma[1 + x] PolyGamma[3, 1 + x], and we see that the string "PolyGamma" appears a total of a(3) = 7 times in this expansion. - _John M. Campbell_, Aug 11 2018

With offset 1, also the number of integer partitions of 2n that do not comprise the multiset of vertex-degrees of any multigraph (i.e., non-multigraphical partitions); see A209816 for multigraphical partitions. - _Gus Wiseman_, Oct 26 2018

Also a(n) is the number of partitions of 2n+1 with exactly one odd part.

Delete the odd part 2k+1, k=0, ..., n, to get a partition of 2n-2k into even parts. There are as many unrestricted partitions of n-k; now sum those numbers from 0 to n to get a(n). - _George Beck_, Jul 22 2019

In the Young's lattice, a(n) is the number of branches that connect the (n-1)-th layer to the n-th layer. - _Shouvik Datta_, Sep 19 2021

a(n) is the number of multiset partitions of the multiset {r^n, s^1}, equivalently, factorization patterns of any number m=p^n*q^1 where p and q are primes. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jan 01 2024
