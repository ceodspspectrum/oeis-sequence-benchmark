Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

For distinct primes p, q, L(p) is congruent to 1 mod p, L(2p) is congruent to 3 mod p and L(pq) is congruent 1 + q(L(q) - 1) mod p. Also, L(m) divides F(2km) and L((2k + 1)m), k, m >= 0.

a(n) = Sum_{k=0..ceiling((n - 1)/2)} P(3; n - 1 - k, k), n >= 1, with a(0) = 2. These are the sums over the SW-NE diagonals in P(3; n, k), the (3, 1) Pascal triangle A093560. Observation by _Paul Barry_, Apr 29 2004. Proof via recursion relations and comparison of inputs. Also SW-NE diagonal sums of the (1, 2) Pascal triangle A029635 (with T(0, 0) replaced by 2).

Suppose psi = log(phi) = A002390. We get the representation L(n) = 2*cosh(n*psi) if n is even; L(n) = 2*sinh(n*psi) if n is odd. There is a similar representation for Fibonacci numbers (A000045). Many Lucas formulas now easily follow from appropriate sinh- and cosh-formulas. For example: the identity cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1 implies L(n)^2 - 5*F(n)^2 = 4*(-1)^n (setting x = n*psi). - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Apr 18 2007

The parity of L(n) follows easily from its definition, which shows that L(n) is even when n is a multiple of 3 and odd otherwise.

The first six multiplication formulas are:

L(2n) = L(n)^2 - 2*(-1)^n;

L(3n) = L(n)^3 - 3*(-1)^n*L(n);

L(4n) = L(n)^4 - 4*(-1)^n*L(n)^2 + 2;

L(5n) = L(n)^5 - 5*(-1)^n*L(n)^3 + 5*L(n);

L(6n) = L(n)^6 - 6*(-1)^n*L(n)^4 + 9*L(n)^2 - 2*(-1)^n.

Generally, L(n) | L(mn) if and only if m is odd.

In the expansion of L(mn), where m represents the multiplier and n the index of a known value of L(n), the absolute values of the coefficients are the terms in the m-th row of the triangle A034807. When m = 1 and n = 1, L(n) = 1 and all the terms are positive and so the row sums of A034807 are simply the Lucas numbers. (End)

The comments submitted by Miklos Kristof on Mar 19 2007 for the Fibonacci numbers (A000045) contain four important identities that have close analogs in the Lucas numbers:

For a >= b and odd  b, L(a + b) + L(a - b) = 5*F(a)*F(b).

For a >= b and even b, L(a + b) + L(a - b) = L(a)*L(b).

For a >= b and odd  b, L(a + b) - L(a - b) = L(a)*L(b).

For a >= b and even b, L(a + b) - L(a - b) = 5*F(a)*F(b).

A particularly interesting instance of the difference identity for even b is L(a + 30) - L(a - 30) = 5*F(a)*832040, since 5*832040 is divisible by 100, proving that the last two digits of Lucas numbers repeat in a cycle of length 60 (see A106291(100)). (End)

From _John Blythe Dobson_, Nov 15 2007: (Start)

The Lucas numbers satisfy remarkable difference equations, in some cases best expressed using Fibonacci numbers, of which representative examples are the following:

L(n) - L(n - 3)  = 2*L(n - 2);

L(n) - L(n - 4)  = 5*F(n - 2);

L(n) - L(n - 6)  = 4*L(n - 3);

L(n) - L(n - 12) = 40*F(n - 6);

L(n) - L(n - 60) = 4160200*F(n - 30).

These formulas establish, respectively, that the Lucas numbers form a cyclic residue system of length 3 (mod 2), of length 4 (mod 5), of length 6 (mod 4), of length 12 (mod 40) and of length 60 (mod 4160200). The divisibility of the last modulus by 100 accounts for the fact that the last two digits of the Lucas numbers begin to repeat at L(60).

The divisibility properties of the Lucas numbers are very complex and still not fully understood, but several important criteria are established in Zhi-Hong Sun's 2003 survey of congruences for Fibonacci numbers. (End)

Inverse binomial transform is (-1)^n * a(n). - _Michael Somos_, Jun 03 2014

Lucas numbers are invariant to the following transformation for all values of the integers j and n, including negative values, thus: L(n) = (L(j+n) + (-1)^n * L(j-n))/L(j). The same transformation applied to all sequences of the form G(n+1) = m * G(n) + G(n-1) yields Lucas numbers for m = 1, except where G(j) = 0, regardless of initial values which may be nonintegers. The corresponding sequences for other values of m are: for m = 2, 2*A001333; for m = 3, A006497; for m = 4, 2*A001077; for m = 5, A087130; for m = 6, 2*A005667; for m = 7, A086902. The invariant ones all have G(0) = 2, G(1) = m. A related family of sequences is discussed at A059100. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Nov 23 2014

A trapezoid has three lengths of sides in order L(n-1), L(n+1), L(n-1). For increasing n a very close approximation to the maximum area will have the fourth side equal to 2*L(n). For a trapezoid with sides L(n-1), L(n-3), L(n-1), the fourth side will be L(n). - _J. M. Bergot_, Mar 17 2016

Lucas numbers L(n) and Fibonacci numbers F(n), being related by the formulas F(n) = (F(n-1) + L(n-1))/2 and L(n) = 2 F(n+1) - F(n), are a typical pair of "autosequences" (see the link to OEIS Wiki). - _Jean-FranÃ§ois Alcover_, Jun 09 2017

For n >= 3, the Lucas number L(n) is the dimension of a commutative Hecke algebra of affine type A_n with independent parameters. See Theorem 1.4, Corollary 1.5, and the table on page 524 in the link "Hecke algebras with independent parameters". - _Jia Huang_, Jan 20 2019

From _Klaus Purath_, Apr 19 2019: (Start)

While all prime numbers appear as factors in the Fibonacci numbers, this is not the case with the Lucas numbers. For example, L(n) is never divisible by the following prime numbers < 150: 5, 13, 17, 37, 53, 61, 73, 89, 97, 109, 113, 137, 149 ... See A053028. Conjecture: Three properties can be determined for these prime numbers:

First observation: The prime factors > 3 occur in the Fibonacci numbers with an odd index.

Second observation: These are the prime numbers p congruent to 2, 3 (modulo 5), which occur both in Fibonacci(p+1) and in Fibonacci((p+1)/2) as prime factors, or the prime numbers p congruent to 1, 4 (modulo 5), which occur both in Fibonacci((p-1)/2) and in Fibonacci((p-1)/(2^k)) with k >= 2.

Third observation: The Pisano period lengths of these prime numbers, given in A001175, are always divisible by 4, but not by 8. In contrast, those of the prime factors of Lucas numbers are divisible either by 2, but not by 4, or by 8. (See also comment in A053028 by N. J. A. Sloane, Feb 21 2004). (End)

L(n) is the sum of 4*k consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (A000045) divided by Fibonacci(2*k): (Sum_{i=0..4*k-1, k>=1} F(n+i))/F(2*k) = L(n+2*k+1). Sequences extended to negative indices, following the rule a(n-1) = a(n+1) - a(n). - _Klaus Purath_, Sep 15 2019

If one forms a sequence (A) of the Fibonacci type with the initial values A(0) = A022095(n) and A(1) = A000285(n), then A(n+1) = L(n+1)^2 always applies. - _Klaus Purath_, Sep 29 2019

L((2*m+1)k)/L(k) = Sum_{i=0..m-1} (-1)^(i*(k+1))*L((2*m-2*i)*k) + (-1)^(m*k).

Example: k=5, m=2, L(5)=11, L(10)=123, L(20)=15127, L(25)=167761. L(25)/L(5) = 15251, L(20) + L(10) + 1 = 15127 + 123 + 1 = 15251.

From _Peter Bala_, Dec 23 2021: (Start)

The Gauss congruences a(n*p^k) == a(n*p^(k-1)) ( mod p^k ) hold for all prime p and positive integers n and k.

For a positive integer k, the sequence (a(n))n>=1 taken modulo k becomes a purely periodic sequence. For example, taken modulo 11, the sequence becomes [1, 3, 4, 7, 0, 7, 7, 3, 10, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 0, 7, 7, 3, 10, 2, ...], a periodic sequence with period 10. (End)

For any sequence with recurrence relation b(n) = b(n-1) + b(n-2), it can be shown that the recurrence relation for every k-th term is given by: b(n) = A000032(k) * b(n-k) + (-1)^(k+1) * b(n-2k), extending to negative indices as necessary. - _Nick Hobson_, Jan 19 2024
