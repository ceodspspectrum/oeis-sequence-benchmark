Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Number of labeled rooted trees with n nodes: n^(n-1).
Comments: Also the number of connected transitive subtree acyclic digraphs on n vertices. - Robert Castelo (rcastelo(AT)imim.es), Jan 06 2001

For any given integer k, a(n) is also the number of functions from {1,2,...,n} to {1,2,...,n} such that the sum of the function values is k mod n. - Sharon Sela (sharonsela(AT)hotmail.com), Feb 16 2002

The n-th term of a geometric progression with first term 1 and common ratio n: a(1) = 1 -> 1,1,1,1,... a(2) = 2 -> 1,2,... a(3) = 9 -> 1,3,9,... a(4) = 64 -> 1,4,16,64,... - _Amarnath Murthy_, Mar 25 2004

All rational solutions to the equation x^y = y^x, with x < y, are given by x = A000169(n+1)/A000312(n), y = A000312(n+1)/A007778(n), where n = 1, 2, 3, ... . - _Nick Hobson_, Nov 30 2006

a(n+1) is also the number of partial functions on n labeled objects. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Dec 25 2006

In other words, if A is a finite set of size n-1, then a(n) is the number of binary relations on A that are also functions. Note that a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n-1} binomial(n-1,k)*(n-1)^k = n^(n-1), where binomial(n-1,k) is the number of ways to select a domain D of size k from A and (n-1)^k is the number of functions from D to A. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Apr 21 2011

More generally, consider the class of sequences of the form a(n) = (n*c(1)*...*c(i))^(n-1). This sequence has c(1)=1. A052746 has a(n) = (2*n)^(n-1), A052756 has a(n) = (3*n)^(n-1), A052764 has a(n) = (4*n)^(n-1), A052789 has a(n) = (5*n)^(n-1) for n>0. These sequences have a combinatorial structure like simple grammars. - _Ctibor O. Zizka_, Feb 23 2008

a(n) is equal to the logarithmic transform of the sequence b(n) = n^(n-2) starting at b(2). - Kevin Hu (10thsymphony(AT)gmail.com), Aug 23 2010

Also, number of labeled connected multigraphs of order n without cycles except one loop. See link below to have a picture showing the bijection between rooted trees and multigraphs of this kind. (Note that there are no labels in the picture, but the bijection remains true if we label the nodes.) - _Washington Bomfim_, Sep 04 2010

a(n) is also the number of functions f:{1,2,...,n} -> {1,2,...,n} such that f(1) = 1.

For a signed version of A000169 arising from the Vandermonde determinant of (1,1/2,...,1/n), see the Mathematica section. - _Clark Kimberling_, Jan 02 2012

Numerator of (1+1/(n-1))^(n-1) for n>1. - _Jean-François Alcover_, Jan 14 2013

Right edge of triangle A075513. - _Michel Marcus_, May 17 2013

a(n+1) is the number of n x n binary matrices with no more than a single one in each row. Partitioning the set of such matrices by the number k of rows with a one, we obtain a(n+1) = Sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k)*n^k = (n+1)^n. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, May 27 2014

Central terms of triangle A051129: a(n) = A051129(2*n-1,n). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Sep 14 2014

a(n) is the row sum of the n-th rows of A248120 and A055302, so it enumerates the monomials in the expansion of [x(1) + x(2) + ... + x(n)]^(n-1). - _Tom Copeland_, Jul 17 2015

For any given integer k, a(n) is the number of sums x_1 + ... + x_m = k (mod n) such that: x_1, ..., x_m are nonnegative integers less than n, the order of the summands does not matter, and each integer appears fewer than n times as a summand. - _Carlo Sanna_, Oct 04 2015

a(n) is the number of words of length n-1 over an alphabet of n letters. - _Joerg Arndt_, Oct 07 2015

a(n) is the number of parking functions whose largest element is n and length is n. For example, a(3) = 9 because there are nine such parking functions, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,3,1), (2,1,3), (3,1,2), (3,2,1), (1,1,3), (1,3,1), (3,1,1). - _Ran Pan_, Nov 15 2015

Consider the following problem: n^2 cells are arranged in a square array. A step can be defined as going from one cell to the one directly above it, to the right of it or under it. A step above cannot be followed by a step below and vice versa. Once the last column of the square array is reached, you can only take steps down. a(n) is the number of possible paths (i.e., sequences of steps) from the cell on the bottom left to the cell on the bottom right. - _Nicolas Nagel_, Oct 13 2016

The rationals c(n) = a(n+1)/a(n), n >= 1, appear in the proof of G. Pólya's "elementary, but not too elementary, theorem": Sum_{n>=1} (Product_{k=1..n} a_k)^(1/n) < exp(1)*Sum_{n>=1} a_n, for n >= 1, with the sequence {a_k}_{k>=1} of nonnegative terms, not all equal to 0. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 16 2018

Coefficients of the generating series for the preLie operadic algebra. Cf. p. 417 of the Loday et al. paper. - _Tom Copeland_, Jul 08 2018

a(n)/2^(n-1) is the square of the determinant of the n X n matrix M_n with elements m(j,k) = cos(Pi*j*k/n). See Zhi-Wei Sun, Petrov link. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Sep 19 2021

a(n) is the determinant of the n X n matrix P_n such that, when indexed [0, n), P(0, j) = 1, P(i <= j) = i, and P(i > j) = i-n. - _C.S. Elder_, Mar 11 2024
