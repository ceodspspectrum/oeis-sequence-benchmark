Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Stirling numbers of second kind S(n,3).
Comments: Number of palindromic structures using exactly three different symbols; Mobius transform: A056279. - _Marks R. Nester_

Number of ways of placing n labeled balls into k=3 indistinguishable boxes. - _Thomas Wieder_, Nov 30 2004

With two leading zeros, this is the second binomial transform of cosh(x)-1 and the binomial transform of A000225 (with extra leading zero). - _Paul Barry_, May 13 2003

Let [m] denote the first m positive integers. Then a(n) is the number of functions f from [n] to [n+1] that satisfy (i) f(x) > x for all x, (ii) f(x) = n+1 for exactly 3 elements and (iii) f(f(x)) = n+1 for the remaining n-3 elements of [n]. For example, a(4)=6 since there are exactly 6 functions from {1,2,3,4} to {1,2,3,4,5} such that f(x) > x, f(x) = 5 for 3 elements and f(f(x)) = 5 for the remaining element. The functions are f1 = {(1,5), (2,5), (3,4), (4,5)}, f2 = {(1,5), (2,3), (3,5), (4,5)}, f3 = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5)}, f4 = {(1,2), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)}, f5 = {(1,3), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)}, f6 = {(1,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)}. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Feb 20 2007

Conjecture. Let S(1)={1} and, for n > 1, let S(n) be the smallest set containing x, 2x and 3x for each element x in S(n-1). Then a(n+2) is the sum of the elements in S(n). (It is easy to prove that the number of elements in S(n) is the n-th triangular number given by A001952.) See A122554 for a sequence defined in this way. - _John W. Layman_, Nov 21 2007; corrected (a(n) to a(n+2) due to offset change) by _Fred Daniel Kline_, Oct 02 2014

Let P(A) be the power set of an n-element set A. Then a(n+1) = the number of pairs of elements {x,y} of P(A) for which x and y are disjoint and for which x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x. Wieder calls these "disjoint strict 2-combinations". - _Ross La Haye_, Jan 11 2008; corrected by _Ross La Haye_, Oct 29 2008

Also, let P(A) be the power set of an n-element set A. Then a(n+2) = the number of pairs of elements {x,y} of P(A) for which either 0) x and y are disjoint and for which either x is a subset of y or y is a subset of x, or 1) x and y are disjoint and for which x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x, or 2) x and y are intersecting and for which either x is a proper subset of y or y is a proper subset of x. - _Ross La Haye_, Jan 11 2008

3 * a(n+1) = p(n+1) where p(x) is the unique degree-n polynomial such that p(k) = a(k+1) for k = 0, 1, ..., n. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 29 2012

John W. Layman's conjecture that a(n+2) is the sum of elements in S(n) follows from the identification of S(n) with the first n rows of A036561, whose row sums are A001047. - _Fred Daniel Kline_, Oct 02 2014

From _M. Sinan Kul_, Sep 08 2016: (Start)

Let m be equal to the product of n-1 distinct primes. Then a(n) is equal to the number of distinct fractions >=1 that may be created by dividing a divisor of m by another divisor. For example for m = 2*3*5 = 30, we would have the following 6 fractions: 6/5, 3/2, 5/3, 5/2, 10/3, 15/2.

Here finding the number of fractions would be equivalent to distributing n-1 balls (distinct primes) to two bins (numerator and denominator) with no empty bins which can be found by Stirling numbers of the second kind. So another definition for a(n) is a(n) = Sum_{i=2..n-1} Stirling2(i,2)*binomial(n-1,i).

Also for n > 0, a(n) = (d(m^2)+1)/2 - d(m) where m is equal to the product of n-1 distinct primes. Example for a(5): m = 2*3*5*7 = 210 (product of four distinct primes) so a(5) = (d(210^2)+1)/2 - d(210) = 41 - 16 = 25. (End)

6*a(n) is the number of ternary strings of length n that contain at least one of each of the 3 symbols on which they are defined. For example, for n=4, the strings are the 12 permutations of 0012, the 12 permutations of 0112, and the 12 permutations of 0122. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Aug 23 2021

A simpler form of La Haye's first comment is: a(n+1) is the number of ways we can form disjoint unions of two nonempty subsets of [n] (see example below). Cf. A001047 for the requirement that the union contains n. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Aug 24 2021

As partial sums of the Nicomachus triangle's rows and the differences of the powers of 3 and 2 (A001047), each iteration corresponds to two figurate variations of the Sierpinski triangle (3^n) with cross-correlation to the Nicomachus triangle, see illustrations in links. The Sierpinski half-hexagons of (A001047) stack and conform to the footprint of 2^n - 1 triangular numbers. The 3^n Sierpinski triangle minus its 2^n bottom row, also correlates to the Nicomachus triangle according to each Sierpinski triangular sub-row. - _John Elias_, Oct 04 2021
