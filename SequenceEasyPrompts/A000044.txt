Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Dying rabbits: a(0) = 1; for 1 <= n <= 12, a(n) = Fibonacci(n); for n >= 13, a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - a(n-13).
Comments: A107358 is a more satisfactory version, but I have left the present sequence unchanged (except for making the definition clearer) since it has been in the OEIS so long.

Number of compositions of n into parts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. - _Joerg Arndt_, Sep 05 2014

If a(0) = 1 then it is not clear why a(2) = 1, it should be equal to a(1) + a(0) = 2. Does the first comment mean that a(0) is erroneous and should read a(0) = 0? In contrast to A107358, the term a(13) = 232 = 144 + 89 - 1 seems correct, since in this month the first and oldest pair of rabbits die. But a(14) should be equal to a(13) + a(12) = 232 + 144 because the first pair (which was also the only one present in month 2) has already died and there is no other pair aged 12 months. In general, the number of pairs which die in month n because they are aged exactly 12 months, equals a(n-14): this is the number of newborn pairs in month n - 12, viz. a(n-12) = a(n-13) [those from preceding month] + a(n-14) [the newborn ones] - #(those which die). - _M.
