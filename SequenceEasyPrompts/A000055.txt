Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of trees with n unlabeled nodes.
Comments: Also, number of unlabeled 2-gonal 2-trees with n 2-gons.

Main diagonal of A054924.

Left border of A157905. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Mar 08 2009

From _Robert Munafo_, Jan 24 2010: (Start)

Also counts classifications of n items that require exactly n-1 binary partitions; see Munafo link at A005646, also A171871 and A171872.

The 11 trees for n = 7 are illustrated at the Munafo web link.

Link to A171871/A171872 conjectured by _Robert Munafo_, then proved by _Andrew Weimholt_ and _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_ on Dec 29 2009. (End)

This is also "Number of tree perfect graphs on n nodes" [see Hougardy]. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 04 2015

For n > 0, a(n) is the number of ways to arrange n-1 unlabeled non-intersecting circles on a sphere. - _Vladimir Reshetnikov_, Aug 25 2016

All trees for n=1 through n=12 are depicted in Chapter 1 of the Steinbach reference. On p. 6 appear encircled two trees (with n=10) which seem inequivalent only when considered as ordered (planar) trees. Earlier instances of such possibly (in)equivalent trees could appear from n=6 on (and from n=9 on without equivalence modulo plane symmetry) but are not drawn separately there. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 29 2017
