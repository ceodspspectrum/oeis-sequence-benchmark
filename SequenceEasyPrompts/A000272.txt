Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of trees on n labeled nodes: n^(n-2) with a(0)=1.
Comments: Number of spanning trees in complete graph K_n on n labeled nodes.

Robert Castelo (rcastelo(AT)imim.es), Jan 06 2001, observes that n^(n-2) is also the number of transitive subtree acyclic digraphs on n-1 vertices.

a(n) is also the number of ways of expressing an n-cycle in the symmetric group S_n as a product of n-1 transpositions, see example. - Dan Fux (dan.fux(AT)OpenGaia.com or danfux(AT)OpenGaia.com), Apr 12 2001

Also counts parking functions, critical configurations of the chip firing game, allowable pairs sorted by a priority queue [Hamel].

The parking functions of length n can be described as all permutations of all words [d(1),d(2), ..., d(n)] where 1 <= d(k) <= k; see example. There are (n+1)^(n-1) = a(n+1) parking functions of length n. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jul 15 2014

a(n+1) is the number of endofunctions with no cycles of length > 1; number of forests of rooted labeled trees on n vertices. - _Mitch Harris_, Jul 06 2006

a(n) is also the number of nilpotent partial bijections (of an n-element set). Equivalently, the number of nilpotents in the partial symmetric semigroup, P sub n. - _Abdullahi Umar_, Aug 25 2008

a(n) is also the number of edge-labeled rooted trees on n nodes. - _Nikos Apostolakis_, Nov 30 2008

a(n+1) is the number of length n sequences on an alphabet of {1,2,...,n} that have a partial sum equal to n. For example a(4)=16 because there are 16 length 3 sequences on {1,2,3} in which the terms (beginning with the first term and proceeding sequentially) sum to 3 at some point in the sequence. {1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 1}, {2, 1, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {3, 1, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 1, 3}, {3, 2, 1}, {3, 2, 2}, {3, 2, 3}, {3, 3, 1}, {3, 3, 2}, {3, 3, 3}. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Jul 20 2009

a(n) is the number of acyclic functions from {1,2,...,n-1} to {1,2,...,n}. An acyclic function f satisfies the following property: for any x in the domain, there exists a positive integer k such that (f^k)(x) is not in the domain. Note that f^k denotes the k-fold composition of f with itself, e.g., (f^2)(x)=f(f(x)). - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Mar 02 2011

a(n) is the absolute value of the discriminant of the polynomial x^{n-1}+...+x+1. More precisely, a(n) = (-1)^{(n-1)(n-2)/2} times the discriminant. - _Zach Teitler_, Jan 28 2014

For n > 2, a(n+2) is the number of nodes in the canonical automaton for the affine Weyl group of type A_n. - _Tom Edgar_, May 12 2016

The tree formula a(n) = n^(n-2) is due to Cayley (see the first comment). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Jan 11 2018

a(n) is the number of topologically distinct lines of play for the game Planted Brussels Sprouts on n vertices. See Ji and Propp link. - _Caleb Ji_, May 11 2018

a(n+1) is also the number of bases of R^n, that can be made from the n(n+1)/2 vectors of the form [0 ... 0 1 ... 1 0 ... 0]^T, where the initial or final zeros are optional, but at least one 1 has to be included. - _Nicolas Nagel_, Jul 31 2018

Cooper et al. show that every connected k-chromatic graph contains at least k^(k-2) spanning trees. - _Michel Marcus_, May 14 2020
