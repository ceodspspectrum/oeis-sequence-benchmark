Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: The characteristic function of {0}: a(n) = 0^n.
Comments: Changing the offset to 1 gives the arithmetical function a(1) = 1, a(n) = 0 for n > 1, the identity function for Dirichlet multiplication (see Apostol). - _N. J. A. Sloane_

Changing the offset to 1 makes this the decimal expansion of 1. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 13 2014

Hankel transform (see A001906 for definition) of A000007 (powers of 0), A000012 (powers of 1), A000079 (powers of 2), A000244 (powers of 3), A000302 (powers of 4), A000351 (powers of 5), A000400 (powers of 6), A000420 (powers of 7), A001018 (powers of 8), A001019 (powers of 9), A011557 (powers of 10), A001020 (powers of 11), etc. - _Philippe DelÃ©ham_, Jul 07 2005

This is the identity sequence with respect to convolution. - _David W. Wilson_, Oct 30 2006

a(A000004(n)) = 1; a(A000027(n)) = 0. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Oct 12 2008

The alternating sum of the n-th row of Pascal's triangle gives the characteristic function of 0, a(n) = 0^n. - _Daniel Forgues_, May 25 2010

The number of maximal self-avoiding walks from the NW to SW corners of a 1 X n grid. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Nov 19 2010

Historically there has been some disagreement as to whether 0^0 = 1. Graphing x^0 seems to support that conclusion, but graphing 0^x instead suggests that 0^0 = 0. Euler and Knuth have argued in favor of 0^0 = 1. For some calculators, 0^0 triggers an error, while in Mathematica, 0^0 is Indeterminate. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 15 2011

Another consequence of changing the offset to 1 is that then this sequence can be described as the sum of Moebius mu(d) for the divisors d of n. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 28 2011

With the convention 0^0 = 1, 0^n = 0 for n > 0, the sequence a(n) = 0^|n-k|, which equals 1 when n = k and is 0 for n >= 0, has g.f. x^k. A000007 is the case k = 0. - _George F. Johnson_, Mar 08 2013

A fixed point of the run length transform. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Oct 21 2016
