Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: a(n) = Fibonacci(n) - 1.
Comments: a(n) is the number of allowable transition rules for passing from one change to the next (on n-1 bells) in the English art of bell-ringing. This is also the number of involutions in the symmetric group S_{n-1} which can be represented as a product of transpositions of consecutive numbers from {1, 2, ..., n-1}. Thus for n = 6 we have a(6) from (12), (12)(34), (12)(45), (23), (23)(45), (34), (45), for instance. See my 1983 Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. paper. - Arthur T. White, letter to _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 18 1986

Number of permutations p of {1, 2, ..., n-1} such that max|p(i) - i| = 1. Example: a(4) = 2 since only the permutations 132 and 213 of {1, 2, 3} satisfy the given condition. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jun 04 2003 [For a(5) = 4 we have 2143, 1324, 2134 and 1243. - _Jon Perry_, Sep 14 2013]

Number of 001-avoiding binary words of length n-3. a(n) is the number of partitions of {1, ..., n-1} into two blocks in which only 1- or 2-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block and there is at least one 2-string. E.g., a(6) = 7 because the enumerated partitions of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are 124/35, 134/25, 14/235, 13/245, 1245/3, 145/23, 125/34. - _Augustine O. Munagi_, Apr 11 2005

Numbers for which only one Fibonacci bit-representation is possible and for which the maximal and minimal Fibonacci bit-representations (A104326 and A014417) are equal. For example, a(12) = 10101 because 8 + 3 + 1 = 12. - _Casey Mongoven_, Mar 19 2006

Beginning with a(2), the "RecamÃ¡n transform" (see A005132) of the Fibonacci numbers (A000045). - _Nick Hobson_, Mar 01 2007

Starting with nonzero terms, a(n) gives the row sums of triangle A158950. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Mar 31 2009

a(n+2) is the minimum number of elements in an AVL tree of height n. - Lennert Buytenhek (buytenh(AT)wantstofly.org), May 31 2010

a(n) is the number of branch nodes in the Fibonacci tree of order n-1. A Fibonacci tree of order n (n >= 2) is a complete binary tree whose left subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-1 and whose right subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-2; each of the Fibonacci trees of order 0 and 1 is defined as a single node (see the Knuth reference, p. 417). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jun 14 2010

a(n+3) is the number of distinct three-strand positive braids of length n (cf. Burckel). - _Maxime Bourrigan_, Apr 04 2011

a(n+1) is the number of compositions of n with maximal part 2. - _Joerg Arndt_, May 21 2013

a(n+2) is the number of leafs of great-grandparent DAG (directed acyclic graph) of height n. A great-grandparent DAG of height n is a single node for n = 1; for n > 1 each leaf of ggpDAG(n-1) has two child nodes where pairs of adjacent new nodes are merged into single node if and only if they have disjoint grandparents and same great-grandparent. Consequence: a(n) = 2*a(n-1) - a(n-3). - _Hermann Stamm-Wilbrandt_, Jul 06 2014

2 and 7 are the only prime numbers in this sequence. - _Emmanuel Vantieghem_, Oct 01 2014

From _Russell Jay Hendel_, Mar 15 2015: (Start)

We can establish _Gerald McGarvey_'s conjecture mentioned in the Formula section, however we require n > 4. We need the following 4 prerequisites.

(1) a(n) = F(n) - 1, with {F(n)}_{n >= 1} the Fibonacci numbers A000045. (2) (Binet form) F(n) = (d^n - e^n)/sqrt(5) with d = phi and e = 1 - phi, de = -1 and d + e = 1. It follows that a(n) = (d(n) - e(n))/sqrt(5) - 1. (3) To prove floor(x) = y is equivalent to proving that x - y lies in the half-open interval [0, 1). (4) The series {s(n) = c1 x^n + c2}_{n >= 1}, with -1 < x < 0, and c1 and c2 positive constants, converges by oscillation with s(1) < s(3) < s(5) < ... < s(6) < s(4) < s(2). If follows that for any odd n, the open interval (s(n), s(n+1)) contains the subsequence {s(t)}_{t >= n + 2}. Using these prerequisites we can analyze the conjecture.

Using prerequisites (2) and (3) we see we must prove, for all n > 4, that d((d^(n-1) - e^(n-1))/sqrt(5) - 1) - (d^n - e^n)/sqrt(5) + 1 + c lies in the interval [0, 1). But de = -1, implying de^(n-1) = -e^(n-2). It follows that we must equivalently prove (for all n > 4) that E(n, c) = (e^(n-2) + e^n)/sqrt(5) + 1 - d + c = e^(n-2) (e^2 + 1)/sqrt(5) + e + c lies in [0, 1). Clearly, for any particular n, E(n, c) has extrema (maxima, minima) when c = 2*(1-d) and c = (1+d)*(1-d). Therefore, the proof is completed by using prerequisite (4). It suffices to verify E(5, 2*(1-d)) = 0, E(6, 2*(1-d)) = 0.236068, E(5, (1-d)*(1+d)) = 0.618034, E(6, (1-d)*(1+d)) = 0.854102, all lie in [0, 1).

a(n) can be shown to be the number of distinct nonempty matchings on a path with n vertices. (A matching is a collection of disjoint edges.) - _Andrew Penland_, Feb 14 2017

a(n+2) is the length of the longest array whose local maximum element can be found in at most n reveals. See link to the puzzle by Alexander S. Kulikov. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Aug 08 2020

a(n+2) is the number of nonempty subsets of {1,2,...,n} that contain no consecutive elements. For example, the a(6)=7 subsets of {1,2,3,4} are {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,3}, {1,4} and {2,4}. - _Muge Olucoglu_, Mar 21 2021

a(n+3) is the number of allowed patterns of length n in the even shift (that is, a(n+3) is the number of binary words of length n in which there are an even number of 0s between any two occurrences of 1). For example, a(7)=12 and the 12 allowed patterns of length 4 in the even shift are 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1100, 1110, 1111. - _Zoran Sunic_, Apr 06 2022

Conjecture: for k a positive odd integer, the sequence {a(k^n): n >= 1} is a strong divisibility sequence; that is, for n, m >= 1, gcd(a(k^n), a(k^m)) = a(k^gcd(n,m)). - _Peter Bala_, Dec 05 2022
