Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of unlabeled rooted trees with n nodes (or connected functions with a fixed point).
Comments: Also, number of ways of arranging n-1 nonoverlapping circles: e.g., there are 4 ways to arrange 3 circles, as represented by ((O)), (OO), (O)O, OOO, also see example. (Of course the rules here are different from the usual counting parentheses problems - compare A000108, A001190, A001699.) See Sloane's link for a proof and Vogeler's link for illustration of a(7) as arrangement of 6 circles.

Take a string of n x's and insert n-1 ^'s and n-1 pairs of parentheses in all possible legal ways (cf. A003018). Sequence gives number of distinct functions. The single node tree is "x". Making a node f2 a child of f1 represents f1^f2. Since (f1^f2)^f3 is just f1^(f2*f3) we can think of it as f1 raised to both f2 and f3, that is, f1 with f2 and f3 as children. E.g., for n=4 the distinct functions are ((x^x)^x)^x; (x^(x^x))^x; x^((x^x)^x); x^(x^(x^x)). - _W. Edwin Clark_ and _Russ Cox_ Apr 29, 2003; corrected by _Keith Briggs_, Nov 14 2005

Also, number of connected multigraphs of order n without cycles except for one loop. - _Washington Bomfim_, Sep 04 2010

Also, number of planted trees with n+1 nodes.

Also called "Polya trees" by Genitrini (2016). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 24 2017
