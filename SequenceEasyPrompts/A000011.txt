Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of n-bead necklaces (turning over is allowed) where complements are equivalent.
Comments: a(n) is also the number of minimal fibrations of a bidirectional n-cycle over the 2-bouquet up to precompositions with automorphisms of the n-cycle and postcomposition with automorphisms of the 2-bouquet. (Boldi et al.) - _Sebastiano Vigna_, Jan 08 2018

For n >= 3, also the number of distinct planar embeddings of the n-sunlet graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, May 21 2024
