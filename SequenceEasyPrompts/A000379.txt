Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Numbers n where total number of 1-bits in the exponents of their prime factorization is even; a 2-way classification of integers: complement of A000028.
Comments: This sequence and A000028 (its complement) give the unique solution to the problem of splitting the positive integers into two classes in such a way that products of pairs of distinct elements from either class occur with the same multiplicities [Lambek and Moser]. Cf. A000069, A001969.

See A000028 for precise definition, Maple program, etc.

The sequence contains products of even number of distinct terms of A050376. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 04 2010

From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Oct 28 2013: (Start)

Or infinitary MÃ¶bius function (A064179) of n equals 1. (This follows from the definition of A064179.)

A number n is in the sequence iff the number k=k(n) of terms of A050376 that divide n with odd maximal exponent is even (see example).

(End)

Numbers n for which A064547(n) [or equally, A268386(n)] is even. Numbers n for which A010060(A268387(n)) = 0. - _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 09 2016

The sequence is closed under the commutative binary operation A059897(.,.). As integers are self-inverse under A059897(.,.), it therefore forms a subgroup of the positive integers considered as a group under A059897(.,.). Specifically (expanding on the comment above dated May 04 2010) it is the subgroup of even length words in A050376, which is the group's lexicographically earliest ordered minimal set of generators. A000028, the set of odd length words in A050376, is its complementary coset. - _Peter Munn_, Nov 01 2019
