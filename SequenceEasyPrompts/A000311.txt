Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Schroeder's fourth problem; also series-reduced rooted trees with n labeled leaves; also number of total partitions of n.
Comments: a(n) is the number of labeled series-reduced rooted trees with n leaves (root has degree 0 or >= 2); a(n-1) = number of labeled series-reduced trees with n leaves. Also number of series-parallel networks with n labeled edges, divided by 2.

A total partition of n is essentially what is meant by the first part of the previous line: take the numbers 12...n, and partition them into at least two blocks. Partition each block with at least 2 elements into at least two blocks. Repeat until only blocks of size 1 remain. (See the reference to Stanley, Vol. 2.) - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 03 2016

Also the number of singleton-reduced phylogenetic trees with n labels. A phylogenetic tree is a series-reduced rooted tree whose leaves are (usually disjoint) nonempty sets. It is singleton-reduced if no non-leaf node covers only singleton branches. For example, the a(4) = 26 trees are:

  {1,2,3,4}  {{1},{2},{3,4}}  {{1},{2,3,4}}

             {{1},{2,3},{4}}  {{1,2},{3,4}}

             {{1,2},{3},{4}}  {{1,2,3},{4}}

             {{1},{2,4},{3}}  {{1,2,4},{3}}

             {{1,3},{2},{4}}  {{1,3},{2,4}}

             {{1,4},{2},{3}}  {{1,3,4},{2}}

                              {{1,4},{2,3}}

                              {{{1},{2,3}},{4}}

                              {{{1,2},{3}},{4}}

                              {{1},{{2},{3,4}}}

                              {{1},{{2,3},{4}}}

                              {{{1},{2,4}},{3}}

                              {{{1,2},{4}},{3}}

                              {{1},{{2,4},{3}}}

                              {{{1,3},{2}},{4}}

                              {{{1},{3,4}},{2}}

                              {{{1,3},{4}},{2}}

                              {{{1,4},{2}},{3}}

                              {{{1,4},{3}},{2}}
