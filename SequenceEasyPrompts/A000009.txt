Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Expansion of Product_{m >= 1} (1 + x^m); number of partitions of n into distinct parts; number of partitions of n into odd parts.
Comments: Partitions into distinct parts are sometimes called "strict partitions".

The number of different ways to run up a staircase with m steps, taking steps of odd sizes (or taking steps of distinct sizes), where the order is not relevant and there is no other restriction on the number or the size of each step taken is the coefficient of x^m.

Ramanujan theta functions: f(q) (see A121373), phi(q) (A000122), psi(q) (A010054), chi(q) (A000700).

The result that number of partitions of n into distinct parts = number of partitions of n into odd parts is due to Euler.

Bijection: given n = L1* 1 + L2*3 + L3*5 + L7*7 + ..., a partition into odd parts, write each Li in binary, Li = 2^a1 + 2^a2 + 2^a3 + ... where the aj's are all different, then expand n = (2^a1 * 1 + ...)*1 + ... by removing the brackets and we get a partition into distinct parts. For the reverse operation, just keep splitting any even number into halves until no evens remain.

Euler transform of period 2 sequence [1,0,1,0,...]. - _Michael Somos_, Dec 16 2002

Number of different partial sums 1+[1,2]+[1,3]+[1,4]+..., where [1,x] indicates a choice. E.g., a(6)=4, as we can write 1+1+1+1+1+1, 1+2+3, 1+2+1+1+1, 1+1+3+1. - _Jon Perry_, Dec 31 2003

a(n) is the sum of the number of partitions of x_j into at most j parts, where j is the index for the j-th triangular number and n-T(j)=x_j. For example; a(12)=partitions into <= 4 parts of 12-T(4)=2 + partitions into <= 3 parts of 12-T(3)=6 + partitions into <= 2 parts of 12-T(2)=9 + partitions into 1 part of 12-T(1)=11 = (2)(11) + (6)(51)(42)(411)(33)(321)(222) + (9)(81)(72)(63)(54)+(11) = 2+7+5+1 = 15. - _Jon Perry_, Jan 13 2004

Number of partitions of n where if k is the largest part, all parts 1..k are present. - _Jon Perry_, Sep 21 2005

Jack Grahl and Franklin T. Adams-Watters prove this claim of Jon Perry's by observing that the Ferrers dual of a "gapless" partition is guaranteed to have distinct parts; since the Ferrers dual is an involution, this establishes a bijection between the two sets of partitions. - _Allan C. Wechsler_, Sep 28 2021

The number of connected threshold graphs having n edges. - Michael D. Barrus (mbarrus2(AT)uiuc.edu), Jul 12 2007

Starting with offset 1 = row sums of triangle A146061 and the INVERT transform of A000700 starting: (1, 0, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -2, 2, -2, 2, -3, 3, -3, 4, -5, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Oct 26 2008

Number of partitions of n in which the largest part occurs an odd number of times and all other parts occur an even number of times. (Such partitions are the duals of the partitions with odd parts.) - _David Wasserman_, Mar 04 2009

Equals A035363 convolved with A010054. The convolution square of A000009 = A022567 = A000041 convolved with A010054. A000041 = A000009 convolved with A035363. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jun 11 2009

Considering all partitions of n into distinct parts: there are A140207(n) partitions of maximal size which is A003056(n), and A051162(n) is the greatest number occurring in these partitions. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jun 13 2009

Equals left border of triangle A091602 starting with offset 1. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Mar 13 2010

Number of symmetric unimodal compositions of n+1 where the maximal part appears once. Also number of symmetric unimodal compositions of n where the maximal part appears an odd number of times. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jun 11 2013

Because for these partitions the exponents of the parts 1, 2, ... are either 0 or 1 (j^0 meaning that part j is absent) one could call these partitions also 'fermionic partitions'. The parts are the levels, that is the positive integers, and the occupation number is either 0 or 1 (like Pauli's exclusion principle). The 'fermionic states' are denoted by these partitions of n. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 14 2014

The set of partitions containing only odd parts forms a monoid under the product described in comments to A047993. - _Richard Locke Peterson_, Aug 16 2018

Ewell (1973) gives a number of recurrences. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 14 2020

a(n) equals the number of permutations p of the set {1,2,...,n+1}, written in one line notation as p = p_1p_2...p_(n+1), satisfying p_(i+1) - p_i <= 1 for 1 <= i <= n, (i.e., those permutations that, when read from left to right, never increase by more than 1) whose major index maj(p) := Sum_{p_i > p_(i+1)} i  equals n. For example, of the 16 permutations on 5 letters satisfying p_(i+1) - p_i <= 1, 1 <= i <= 4, there are exactly two permutations whose major index is 4, namely, 5 3 4 1 2 and 2 3 4 5 1. Hence a(4) = 2. See the Bala link in A007318 for a proof. - _Peter Bala_, Mar 30 2022

Conjecture: Each positive integer n can be written as a_1 + ... + a_k, where a_1,...,a_k are strict partition numbers (i.e., terms of the current sequence) with no one dividing another. This has been verified for n = 1..1350. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Apr 14 2023

Conjecture: For each integer n > 7, a(n) divides none of p(n), p(n) - 1 and p(n) + 1, where p(n) is the number of partitions of n given by A000041. This has been verified for n up to 10^5. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, May 20 2023 [Verified for n <= 2*10^6. - _Vaclav Kotesovec_, May 23 2023]
