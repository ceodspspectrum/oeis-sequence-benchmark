Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Let n = p_1^e_1 p_2^e_2 p_3^e_3 ... be the prime factorization of n. Sequence gives n such that the sum of the numbers of 1's in the binary expansions of e_1, e_2, e_3, ... is odd.
Comments: This sequence and A000379 (its complement) give the unique solution to the problem of splitting the positive integers into two classes in such a way that products of pairs of distinct elements from either class occur with the same multiplicities [Lambek and Moser]. Cf. A000069, A001969.

Contains (for example) 180, so is different from A123193. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 20 2007

The sequence contains products of odd number of distinct terms of A050376. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 04 2010

From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Oct 28 2013: (Start)

Numbers n such that infinitary Moebius function of n (A064179) equals -1. This follows from the definition of A064179.

Number n is in the sequence if and only if the number k=k(n) of terms of A050376 which divide n with odd maximal exponent is odd.

For example, if n=96, then the maximal exponent of 2 that divides 96 is 5, for 3 it is 1, for 4 it is 2, for 16 it is 1. Thus k(96)=3 and 96 is a term.

(End)

Positions of odd terms in A064547, A268386 and A293439. - _Antti Karttunen_, Nov 09 2017

Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers such that no term is the A059897 product of 2 terms. (A059897 can be considered as a multiplicative operator related to the Fermi-Dirac factorization of numbers described in A050376.) Specifying that the A059897 product be of 2 distinct terms leaves the sequence unchanged. The equivalent sequences using standard integer multiplication are A026416 (with the 2 terms specified as distinct) and A026424 (otherwise). - _Peter Munn_, Mar 16 2019
