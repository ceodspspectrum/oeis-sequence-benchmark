Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Definition (1): Number of n-bead binary necklaces with beads of 2 colors where the colors may be swapped but turning over is not allowed.
Comments: Definition (2): Equivalently, number of different output sequences from an n-stage pure cycling shift register when 2 sequences are considered the same if one is the complement of the other.

Definition (3): Also number of different output sequences from an n-stage pure cycling shift register constrained so contents have even weight.

Definition (4): Also number of output sequences from (n-1)-stage shift register which feeds back the mod 2 sum of the contents of the register.

The equivalence of definitions (1) and (2) follows at once from the definitions.

If u is an output sequence of type (2) then its derivative is of type (3) - so (2) and (3) count the same things.

If we have a shift register of type (4), append a new cell which contains the mod 2 sum of the contents to get a shift register of type (3). So (3) and (4) count the same things.

If n is even, a(n) = A000116(n/2). If 2^(n+1)-1 is prime, then a(n) = A128976(n+1), the number of cycles in the digraph of the Lucas-Lehmer operator LL(x) = x^2 - 2 acting on Z/(2^(n+1)-1). - _M. F. Hasler_, May 19 2007

Also number of 2n-bead balanced binary necklaces that are equivalent to their complements. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Sep 29 2017
