Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = floor(n^2/3).
Comments: Let M_n be the n X n matrix of the following form: [3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 / 2 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 / 1 2 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 / 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 / 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 0 0 / 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 0 / 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 0 / 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 1 / 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 2 / 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3]. Then for n > 2 a(n) = det M_(n-2). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Jun 20 2002

Largest possible size for the directed Cayley graph on two generators having diameter n - 2. - _Ralf Stephan_, Apr 27 2003

It seems that for n >= 2, a(n) is the maximum number of non-overlapping 1 X 3 rectangles that can be packed into an n X n square. Rectangles can only be placed parallel to the sides of the square. Verified with Lobato's tool, see links. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Aug 03 2009

Maximum number of edges in a K4-free graph with n vertices. - _Yi Yang_, May 23 2012

3a(n) + 1 = y^2 if n is not 0 mod 3 and 3a(n) = y^2 otherwise. - _Jon Perry_, Sep 10 2012

Apart from the initial term this is the elliptic troublemaker sequence R_n(1, 3) (also sequence R_n(2, 3)) in the notation of Stange (see Table 1, p. 16). For other elliptic troublemaker sequences R_n(a, b) see the cross references below. - _Peter Bala_, Aug 08 2013

The number of partitions of 2n into exactly 3 parts. - _Colin Barker_, Mar 22 2015

a(n-1) is the maximum number of non-overlapping triples (i,k), (i+1, k+1), (i+2, k+2) in an n X n matrix. Details: The triples are distributed along the main diagonal and 2*(n-1) other diagonals. Their maximum number is floor(n/3) + 2*Sum_{k = 1..n-1} floor(k/3) = floor((n-1)^2/3). - _Gerhard Kirchner_, Feb 04 2017

Conjecture:  a(n) is the number of intersection points of n —Åevians that cut a triangle into the maximum number of pieces (see A007980). - _Anton Zakharov_, May 07 2017

From _Gus Wiseman_, Oct 05 2020: (Start)

Also the number of unimodal triples (meaning the middle part is not strictly less than both of the other two) of positive integers summing to n + 1. The a(2) = 1 through a(6) = 12 triples are:

  (1,1,1)  (1,1,2)  (1,1,3)  (1,1,4)  (1,1,5)

           (1,2,1)  (1,2,2)  (1,2,3)  (1,2,4)

           (2,1,1)  (1,3,1)  (1,3,2)  (1,3,3)

                    (2,2,1)  (1,4,1)  (1,4,2)

                    (3,1,1)  (2,2,2)  (1,5,1)

                             (2,3,1)  (2,2,3)

                             (3,2,1)  (2,3,2)

                             (4,1,1)  (2,4,1)

                                      (3,2,2)

                                      (3,3,1)

                                      (4,2,1)

                                      (5,1,1)
