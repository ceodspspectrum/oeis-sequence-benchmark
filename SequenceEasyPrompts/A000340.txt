Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(0)=1, a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + n + 1.
Comments: From _Johannes W. Meijer_, Feb 20 2009: (Start)

Second right hand column (n-m=1) of the A156920 triangle.

The generating function of this sequence enabled the analysis of the polynomials A156921 and A156925.

(End)

Partial sums of A003462, and thus the second partial sums of A000244 (3^n). Also column k=2 of A106516. - _John Keith_, Jan 04 2022
