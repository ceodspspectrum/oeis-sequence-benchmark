Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Dedekind numbers or Dedekind's problem: number of monotone Boolean functions of n variables, number of antichains of subsets of an n-set, number of elements in a free distributive lattice on n generators, number of Sperner families.
Comments: A monotone Boolean function is an increasing functions from P(S), the set of subsets of S, to {0,1}.

The count of antichains includes the empty antichain which contains no subsets and the antichain consisting of only the empty set.

a(n) is also equal to the number of upsets of an n-set S. A set U of subsets of S is an upset if whenever A is in U and B is a superset of A then B is in U. - _W. Edwin Clark_, Nov 06 2003

Also the number of simple games with n players in minimal winning form. - _Fabián Riquelme_, May 29 2011

The unlabeled case is A003182. - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 20 2019

From _Amiram Eldar_, May 28 2021 and _Michel Marcus_, Apr 07 2023: (Start)

The terms were first calculated by:

  a(0)-a(4) - Dedekind (1897)

  a(5) - Church (1940)

  a(6) - Ward (1946)

  a(7) - Church (1965, verified by Berman and Kohler, 1976)

  a(8) - Wiedemann (1991)

  a(9) - Jäkel (2023)

  a(9) - independently computed by Lennart Van Hirtum, Patrick De Causmaecker, Jens Goemaere, Tobias Kenter, Heinrich Riebler, Michael Lass, and Christian Plessl (2023)
