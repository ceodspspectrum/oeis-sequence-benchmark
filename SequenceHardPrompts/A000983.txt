Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Size of minimal binary covering code of length n and covering radius 1.
Comments: For k > 0, a(2^k-1) = 2^(2^k-k-1). In this case the minimal covering code is also a Hamming code.

In the game described in the Wikipedia link, with n players, the optimal strategy wins with probability 1-a(n)/2^n. In the optimal strategy, the players first agree on a minimal covering code of length n. After the hats are placed, each player knows two words of length n such that one of them is the hat colors of the n players. If one of these two words is a member of the covering code and the other word is not, that player guesses the word that is not. Otherwise, that player does not guess. This strategy guarantees that the team wins for all words that are not members of the covering code.

Because each codeword covers n+1 of the 2^n words, A053637(n+1) is a lower bound. - _Rob Pratt_, Jan 05 2015

a(n) is also the domination number of the n-hypercube graph Q_n. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Feb 20 2016

The next term a(10) is in the range 107-120. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Sep 01 2016
