Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Length of longest simple cycle without chords in the n-dimensional hypercube graph. Also called n-coil or closed n-snake-in-the-box problem.
Comments: This sequence actually gives the length of a longest closed chordless path in the n-dimensional hypercube. To distinguish closed and open paths, newer terminology uses "n-coil" for closed and "n-snake" for open paths. See also A099155.

Longest closed achordal path in n-dimensional hypercube.

After 48, lower bounds on the next terms are 96, 180, 344, 630, 1236. - Darren Casella (artdeco42(AT)yahoo.com), Mar 04 2005
