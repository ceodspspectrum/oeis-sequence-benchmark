Then this sequence is computed as the number of triples (S,D,p), where S is a \"replete\" subsemigroup of T_n (i.e. a subsemigroup for which (xuy) and (xvy) in S implies (xuvy) is in S), D is a \"sparse\" subset of T_n (i.e., for s and t in D, alpha(s) a subset of alpha(t) implies s = t), S \"dominates\" D (i.e. for s in S and t in D, alpha(s) is not a subset of alpha(t) and S is closed under multiplication by elements of D) and p is a \"parity\" function from the image of S under alpha to {0,1}.

Considering different values of x, this yields the trivial relations 0 ~ 0 and 1 ~ 1, then 2 ~ 4, whence x+2 ~ x+4 for every x. By a parity argument and induction, this entirely determines the congruence: 2 is related to every larger even number and 3 is related to every larger odd number. Thus the resulting rig thus has 4 elements: 0, 1 and the equivalence classes of 2 and 3."], "xref": ["Cf.
