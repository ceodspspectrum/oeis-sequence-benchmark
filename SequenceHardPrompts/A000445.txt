Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Latest possible occurrence of the first consecutive pair of n-th power residues, modulo any prime.
Comments: The paper by Adolf Hildebrand proves that a(n) is finite for all n. - _Christopher E. Thompson_, Dec 05 2019

_Don Reble_ has reported computations proving that 1499876 <= a(8) <= 1508324, which improves on the references below. Note also that it shows a(8) < a(7). - _Christopher E. Thompson_, Jan 14 2020
