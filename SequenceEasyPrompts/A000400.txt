Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Powers of 6: a(n) = 6^n.
Comments: Same as Pisot sequences E(1, 6), L(1, 6), P(1, 6), T(1, 6). Essentially same as Pisot sequences E(6, 36), L(6, 36), P(6, 36), T(6, 36). See A008776 for definitions of Pisot sequences.

Central terms of the triangle in A036561. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 14 2006

a(n) = A169604(n)/3; a(n+1) = 2*A169604(n). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 02 2010

Number of pentagons contained within pentaflakes. - _William A. Tedeschi_, Sep 12 2010

Sum of coefficients of expansion of (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)^n.

a(n) is number of compositions of natural numbers into n parts less than 6. For example, a(2) = 36, and there are 36 compositions of natural numbers into 2 parts less than 6.

The compositions of n in which each part is colored by one of  p different colors are called p-colored compositions of n. For n >= 1, a(n) equals the number of 5-colored compositions of n such that no adjacent parts have the same color.

Number of words of length n over the alphabet of six letters. - _Joerg Arndt_, Sep 16 2014

The number of ordered triples (x, y, z) of binary words of length n such that D(x,z) = D(x, y) + D(y, z) where D(a, b) is the Hamming distance from a to b. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Mar 06 2017

a(n) is the area of a triangle with vertices at (2^n, 3^n), (2^(n+1), 3^(n+1)), and (2^(n+2), 3^(n+2)); a(n) is also one fifth the area of a triangle with vertices at (2^n, 3^(n+2)), (2^(n+1), 3^(n+1)), and (2^(n+2), 3^n). - _J. M. Bergot_, May 07 2018

a(n) is the number of possible outcomes of n distinguishable 6-sided dice. - _Stefano Spezia_, Jul 06 2024
