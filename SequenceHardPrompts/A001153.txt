Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Degrees of primitive irreducible trinomials: n such that 2^n - 1 is a Mersenne prime and x^n + x^k + 1 is a primitive irreducible polynomial over GF(2) for some k with 0 < k < n.
Comments: Also the list of "irreducible Mersenne trinomials" since here irreducible implies primitive.

Further terms of the form +-3 (mod 8) are unlikely, as the only possibility of an irreducible trinomial for n == +-3 (mod 8) is (by Swan's theorem) x^n+x^2+1 (and its reciprocal); see the Ciet et al. and the Swan reference. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jan 06 2014

The first Mersenne prime exponent not ruled out by Swan's theorem and yet not a member of this sequence is 57885161. - _Gord Palameta_, Jul 20 2018

74207281 is also in the sequence. - _Gord Palameta_, Jul 20 2018
