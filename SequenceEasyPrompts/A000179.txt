Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Ménage numbers: a(0) = 1, a(1) = -1, and for n >= 2, a(n) = number of permutations s of [0, ..., n-1] such that s(i) != i and s(i) != i+1 (mod n) for all i.
Comments: According to rook theory, _John Riordan_ considered a(1) to be -1. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 02 2010

This is also the value that the formulas of Touchard and of Wyman and Moser give and is compatible with many recurrences. - _William P. Orrick_, Aug 31 2020

Or, for n >= 3, the number of 3 X n Latin rectangles the second row of which is full cycle with a fixed order of its elements, e.g., the cycle (x_2,x_3,...,x_n,x_1) with x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Mar 22 2010

Muir (p. 112) gives essentially this recurrence (although without specifying any initial conditions). Compare A186638. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 24 2011

Sequence discovered by Touchard in 1934. - _L. Edson Jeffery_, Nov 13 2013

Although these are also known as Touchard numbers, the problem was formulated by Lucas in 1891, who gave the recurrence formula shown below. See Cerasoli et al., 1988. - _Stanislav Sykora_, Mar 14 2014

An equivalent problem was formulated by Tait; solutions to Tait's problem were given by Muir (1878) and Cayley (1878). - _William P. Orrick_, Aug 31 2020

From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jun 25 2015: (Start)

According to the ménage problem, 2*n!*a(n) is the number of ways of seating n married couples at 2*n chairs around a circular table, men and women in alternate positions, so that no husband is next to his wife.

It is known [Riordan, ch. 7] that a(n) is the number of arrangements of n non-attacking rooks on the positions of the 1's in an n X n (0,1)-matrix A_n with 0's in positions (i,i), i = 1,...,n, (i,i+1), i = 1,...,n-1, and (n,1). This statement could be written as a(n) = per(A_n). For example, A_5 has the form

    001*11

    1*0011

    11001*                        (1)

    11*100

    0111*0,

where 5 non-attacking rooks are denoted by {1*}.

We can indicate a one-to-one correspondence between arrangements of n non-attacking rooks on the 1's of a matrix A_n and arrangements of n married couples around a circular table by the rules of the ménage problem, after the ladies w_1, w_2, ..., w_n have taken the chairs numbered

    2*n, 2, 4, ..., 2*n-2         (2)

respectively. Suppose we consider an arrangement of rooks: (1,j_1), (2,j_2), ..., (n,j_n). Then the men m_1, m_2, ..., m_n took chairs with numbers

    2*j_i - 3 (mod 2*n),          (3)

where the residues are chosen from the interval[1,2*n]. Indeed {j_i} is a permutation of 1,...,n. So {2*j_i-3}(mod 2*n) is a permutation of odd positive integers <= 2*n-1. Besides, the distance between m_i and w_i cannot be 1. Indeed, the equality |2*(j_i-i)-1| = 1 (mod 2*n) is possible if and only if either j_i=i or j_i=i+1 (mod n) that correspond to positions of 0's in matrix A_n.

For example, in the case of positions of {1*} in(1) we have j_1=3, j_2=1, j_3=5, j_4=2, j_5=4. So, by(2) and (3) the chairs 1,2,...,10 are taken by m_4, w_2, m_1, w_3, m_5, w_4, m_3, w_5, m_2, w_1, respectively. (End)

The first 20 terms of this sequence were calculated in 1891 by E. Lucas (see [Lucas, p. 495]). - _Peter J. C. Moses_, Jun 26 2015

From _Ira M. Gessel_, Nov 27 2018: (Start)

If we invert the formula

  Sum_{ n>=0 } u_n z^n = ((1-z)/(1+z)) F(z/(1+z)^2)

that Don Knuth mentions (see link) (i.e., set x=z/(1+z)^2 and solve for z in terms of x), we get a formula for F(z) = Sum_{n >= 0} n! z^n as a sum with all positive coefficients of (almost) powers of the Catalan number generating function.

The exact formula is (5) of the Yiting Li article.

This article also gives a combinatorial proof of this formula (though it is not as simple as one might want). (End)
