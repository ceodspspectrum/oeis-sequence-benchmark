Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Eulerian numbers (Euler's triangle: column k=2 of A008292, column k=1 of A173018).
Comments: There are 2 versions of Euler's triangle:

* A008292 Classic version of Euler's triangle used by Comtet (1974).

* A173018 Version of Euler's triangle used by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik in Concrete Math. (1990).

Euler's triangle rows and columns indexing conventions:

* A008292 The rows and columns of the Eulerian triangle are both indexed starting from 1. (Classic version: used in the classic books by Riordan and Comtet.)

* A173018 The rows and columns of the Eulerian triangle are both indexed starting from 0. (Graham et al.)

Number of Dyck paths of semilength n having exactly one long ascent (i.e., ascent of length at least two). Example: a(4)=11 because among the 14 Dyck paths of semilength 4, the paths that do not have exactly one long ascent are UDUDUDUD (no long ascent), UUDDUUDD and UUDUUDDD (two long ascents). Here U=(1,1) and D=(1,-1). Also number of ordered trees with n edges having exactly one branch node (i.e., vertex of outdegree at least two). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Feb 22 2004

Number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} with exactly one descent (i.e., permutations (p(1),p(2),...,p(n)) such that #{i: p(i)>p(i+1)}=1). E.g., a(3)=4 because the permutations of {1,2,3} with one descent are 132, 213, 231 and 312.

a(n+1) is the convolution of nonnegative integers (A001477) and powers of two (A000079). - _Graeme McRae_, Jun 07 2006

Partial sum of main diagonal of A125127. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Nov 22 2006

Number of partitions of an n-set having exactly one block of size > 1. Example: a(4)=11 because, if the partitioned set is {1,2,3,4}, then we have 1234, 123|4, 124|3, 134|2, 1|234, 12|3|4, 13|2|4, 14|2|3, 1|23|4, 1|24|3 and 1|2|34. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Oct 28 2006

n divides a(n+1) for n = A014741(n) = {1, 2, 6, 18, 42, 54, 126, 162, 294, 342, 378, 486, 882, 1026, ...}. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Nov 03 2006

(Number of permutations avoiding patterns 321, 2413, 3412, 21534) minus one. - _Jean-Luc Baril_, Nov 01 2007, Mar 21 2008

The chromatic invariant of the prism graph P_n for n >= 3. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Aug 29 2008

Decimal integer corresponding to the result of XORing the binary representation of 2^n - 1 and the binary representation of n with leading zeros. This sequence and a few others are syntactically similar. For n > 0, let D(n) denote the decimal integer corresponding to the binary number having n consecutive 1's. Then D(n).OP.n represents the n-th term of a sequence when .OP. stands for a binary operator such as '+', '-', '*', 'quotentof', 'mod', 'choose'. We then get the various sequences A136556, A082495, A082482, A066524, A000295, A052944. Another syntactically similar sequence results when we take the n-th term as f(D(n)).OP.f(n). For example if f='factorial' and .OP.='/', we get (A136556)(A000295) ; if f='squaring' and .OP.='-', we get (A000295)(A052944). - _K.V.Iyer_, Mar 30 2009

Chromatic invariant of the prism graph Y_n.

Number of labelings of a full binary tree of height n-1, such that each path from root to any leaf contains each label from {1,2,...,n-1} exactly once. - Michael Vielhaber (vielhaber(AT)gmail.com), Nov 18 2009

Also number of nontrivial equivalence classes generated by the weak associative law X((YZ)T)=(X(YZ))T on words with n open and n closed parentheses. Also the number of join (resp. meet)-irreducible elements in the pruning-grafting lattice of binary trees with n leaves. - Jean Pallo, Jan 08 2010

Nonzero terms of this sequence can be found from the row sums of the third sub-triangle extracted from Pascal's triangle as indicated below by braces:

                     1;

                  1,    1;

              {1},   2,    1;

           {1,    3},   3,    1;

        {1,    4,    6},   4,    1;

     {1,    5,   10,   10},   5,    1;

  {1,    6,   15,   20,   15},   6,    1;

For integers a, b, denote by a<+>b the least c >= a, such that the Hamming distance D(a,c) = b (note that, generally speaking, a<+>b differs from b<+>a). Then for n >= 3, a(n) = n<+>n. This has a simple explanation: for n >= 3 in binary we have a(n) = (2^n-1)-n = "anti n". - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Feb 14 2012

a(n) is the number of binary sequences of length n having at least one pair 01. - _Branko Curgus_, May 23 2012

Nonzero terms are those integers k for which there exists a perfect (Hamming) error-correcting code. - _L. Edson Jeffery_, Nov 28 2012

a(n) is the number of length n binary words constructed in the following manner:  Select two positions in which to place the first two 0's of the word.  Fill in all (possibly none) of the positions before the second 0 with 1's and then complete the word with an arbitrary string of 0's or 1's. So a(n) = Sum_{k=2..n} (k-1)*2^(n-k). - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Dec 12 2013

Without first 0: a(n)/2^n equals Sum_{k=0..n} k/2^k. For example: a(5)=57, 57/32 = 0/1 + 1/2 + 2/4 + 3/8 + 4/16 + 5/32. - _Bob Selcoe_, Feb 25 2014

The first barycentric coordinate of the centroid of the first n rows of Pascal's triangle, assuming the numbers are weights, is A000295(n+1)/A000337(n). See attached figure. - _CÃ©sar Eliud Lozada_, Nov 14 2014

Starting (0, 1, 4, 11, ...), this is the binomial transform of (0, 1, 2, 2, 2, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jul 27 2015

a(n) is the number of swaps needed in the worst case to transform a binary tree with n full levels into a heap, using (bottom-up) heapify. - _Rudy van Vliet_, Sep 19 2017

The utility of large networks, particularly social networks, with n participants is given by the terms a(n) of this sequence. This assertion is known as Reed's Law, see the Wikipedia link. - _Johannes W. Meijer_, Jun 03 2019

a(n-1) is the number of subsets of {1..n} in which the largest element of the set exceeds by at least 2 the next largest element. For example, for n = 5, a(4) = 11 and the 11 sets are {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {3,5}, {1,2,4}, {1,2,5}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,5}, {1,2,3,5}. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Apr 08 2020

a(n-1) is also the number of subsets of {1..n} in which the second smallest element of the set exceeds by at least 2 the smallest element. For example, for n = 5, a(4) = 11 and the 11 sets are {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {3,5}, {1,3,4}, {1,3,5}, {1,4,5}, {2,4,5}, {1,3,4,5}. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Apr 09 2020

a(n+1) is the sum of the smallest elements of all subsets of {1..n}. For example, for n=3, a(4)=11; the subsets of {1,2,3} are {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}, and the sum of smallest elements is 11. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Aug 20 2020

Number of subsets of an n-set that have more than one element. - _Eric M. Schmidt_, Mar 13 2021

Number of individual bets in a "full cover" bet on n-1 horses, dogs, etc. in different races. Each horse, etc. can be bet on or not, giving 2^n bets.  But, by convention, singles (a bet on only one race) are not included, reducing the total number bets by n.  It is also impossible to bet on no horses at all, reducing the number of bets by another 1.  A full cover on 4 horses, dogs, etc. is therefore 6 doubles, 4 trebles and 1 four-horse etc. accumulator.  In British betting, such a bet on 4 horses etc. is a Yankee; on 5, a super-Yankee. - _Paul Duckett_, Nov 17 2021

From _Enrique Navarrete_, May 25 2022: (Start)

Number of binary sequences of length n with at least two 1's.

a(n-1) is the number of ways to choose an odd number of elements greater than or equal to 3 out of n elements.

a(n+1) is the number of ways to split [n] = {1,2,...,n} into two (possibly empty) complementary intervals {1,2,...,i} and {i+1,i+2,...,n} and then select a subset from the first interval (2^i choices, 0 <= i <= n), and one block/cell (i.e., subinterval) from the second interval (n-i choices, 0 <= i <= n).

(End)

Number of possible conjunctions in a system of n planets; for example, there can be 0 conjunctions with one planet, one with two planets, four with three planets (three pairs of planets plus one with all three) and so on. - _Wendy Appleby_, Jan 02 2023

Largest exponent m such that 2^m divides (2^n-1)!. - _Franz Vrabec_, Aug 18 2023

It seems that a(n-1) is the number of odd r with 0 < r < 2^n for which there exist u,v,w in the x-independent beginning of the Collatz trajectory of 2^n x + r with u+v = w+1, as detailed in the link "Collatz iteration and Euler numbers?". A better understanding of this might also give a formula for A374527. - _Markus Sigg_, Aug 02 2024
