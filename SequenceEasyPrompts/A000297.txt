Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = (n+1)*(n+3)*(n+8)/6.
Comments: If Y and Z are 2-blocks of an n-set X then, for n>=4, a(n-5) is the number of (n-3)-subsets of X intersecting both Y and Z. - _Milan Janjic_, Nov 09 2007

a(n) is the number of triangles in the Turan graph T(n, n-2) for n>3. - _Robert H Cowen_, Feb 25 2018
