Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Subfactorial or rencontres numbers, or derangements: number of permutations of n elements with no fixed points.
Comments: Euler not only gives the first ten or so terms of the sequence, he also proves both recurrences a(n) = (n-1)*(a(n-1) + a(n-2)) and a(n) = n*a(n-1) + (-1)^n.

a(n) is the permanent of the matrix with 0 on the diagonal and 1 elsewhere. - Yuval Dekel, Nov 01 2003

a(n) is the number of desarrangements of length n. A desarrangement of length n is a permutation p of {1,2,...,n} for which the smallest of all the ascents of p (taken to be n if there are no ascents) is even. Example: a(3) = 2 because we have 213 and 312 (smallest ascents at i = 2). See the J. Désarménien link and the Bona reference (p. 118). - _Emeric Deutsch_, Dec 28 2007

a(n) is the number of deco polyominoes of height n and having in the last column an even number of cells. A deco polyomino is a directed column-convex polyomino in which the height, measured along the diagonal, is attained only in the last column. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Dec 28 2007

a(n) is the number of permutations p of {1,2,...,n} with p(1)!=1 and having no right-to-left minima in consecutive positions. Example a(3) = 2 because we have 231 and 321. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Mar 12 2008

a(n) is the number of permutations p of {1,2,...,n} with p(n)! = n and having no left to right maxima in consecutive positions. Example a(3) = 2 because we have 312 and 321. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Mar 12 2008

From _Emeric Deutsch_, Apr 02 2009: (Start)

a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having exactly one small ascent. A small ascent in a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) is a position i such that p_{i+1} - p_i = 1. (Example: a(3) = 2 because we have 312 and 231; see the Charalambides reference, pp. 176-180.) [See also David, Kendall and Barton, p. 263. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 11 2014]

a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having exactly one small descent. A small descent in a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) is a position i such that p_i - p_{i+1} = 1. (Example: a(3)=2 because we have 132 and 213.) (End)

For n > 2, a(n) + a(n-1) = A000255(n-1); where A000255 = (1, 1, 3, 11, 53, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 16 2009

Connection to A002469 (game of mousetrap with n cards): A002469(n) = (n-2)*A000255(n-1) + A000166(n). (Cf. triangle A159610.) - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 17 2009

From _Emeric Deutsch_, Jul 18 2009: (Start)

a(n) is the sum of the values of the largest fixed points of all non-derangements of length n-1. Example: a(4)=9 because the non-derangements of length 3 are 123, 132, 213, and 321, having largest fixed points 3, 1, 3, and 2, respectively.

a(n) is the number of non-derangements of length n+1 for which the difference between the largest and smallest fixed point is 2. Example: a(3) = 2 because we have 1'43'2 and 32'14'; a(4) = 9 because we have 1'23'54, 1'43'52, 1'53'24, 52'34'1, 52'14'3, 32'54'1, 213'45', 243'15', and 413'25' (the extreme fixed points are marked).

a(n), n >= 1, is also the number of unordered necklaces with n beads, labeled differently from 1 to n, where each necklace has >= 2 beads. This produces the M2 multinomial formula involving partitions without part 1 given below. Because M2(p) counts the permutations with cycle structure given by partition p, this formula gives the number of permutations without fixed points (no 1-cycles), i.e., the derangements, hence the subfactorials with their recurrence relation and inputs. Each necklace with no beads is assumed to contribute a factor 1 in the counting, hence a(0)=1. This comment derives from a family of recurrences found by Malin Sjodahl for a combinatorial problem for certain quark and gluon diagrams (Feb 27 2010). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 01 2010

From _Emeric Deutsch_, Sep 06 2010: (Start)

a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n, n+1} starting with 1 and having no successions. A succession in a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) is a position i such that p_{i+1} - p_i = 1. Example: a(3)=2 because we have 1324 and 1432.

a(n) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} that do not start with 1 and have no successions. A succession in a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) is a position i such that p_{i+1} - p_i = 1. Example: a(3)=2 because we have 213 and 321.

The number of interior lattice points of the subpolytope of the n-dimensional permutohedron whose vertices correspond to permutations avoiding 132 and 312. - _Robert Davis_, Oct 05 2016

Consider n circles of different radii, where each circle is either put inside some bigger circle or contains a smaller circle inside it (no common points are allowed). Then a(n) gives the number of such combinations. - _Anton Zakharov_, Oct 12 2016

If we partition the permutations of [n+1] in A000240 according to their starting digit, we will get (n+1) equinumerous classes each of size a(n), i.e., A000240(n+1) = (n+1)*a(n), hence a(n) is the size of each class of permutations of [n+1] in A000240. For example, for n = 4 we have 45 = 5*9. - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 10 2017

Call d_n1 the permutations of [n] that have the substring n1 but no substring in {12,23,...,(n-1)n}. If we partition them according to their starting digit, we will get (n-1) equinumerous classes each of size A000166(n-2) (the class starting with the digit 1 is empty since we must have the substring n1). Hence d_n1 = (n-1)*A000166(n-2) and A000166(n-2) is the size of each nonempty class in d_n1. For example, d_71 = 6*44 = 264, so there are 264 permutations in d_71 distributed in 6 nonempty classes of size A000166(5) = 44. (To get permutations in d_n1 recursively from more basic ones see the link "Forbidden Patterns" below.) - _Enrique Navarrete_, Jan 15 2017

Also the number of maximum matchings and minimum edge covers in the n-crown graph. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Jun 14 and Dec 24 2017

The sequence a(n) taken modulo a positive integer k is periodic with exact period dividing k when k is even and dividing 2*k when k is odd. This follows from the congruence a(n+k) = (-1)^k*a(n) (mod k) for all n and k, which in turn is easily proved by induction making use of the recurrence a(n) = n*a(n-1) + (-1)^n. - _Peter Bala_, Nov 21 2017

a(n) is the number of distinct possible solutions for a directed, no self loop containing graph (not necessarily connected) that has n vertices, and each vertex has an in- and out-degree of exactly 1. - _Patrik Holopainen_, Sep 18 2018

a(n) is the dimension of the kernel of the random-to-top and random-to-random shuffling operators over a collection of n objects (in a vector space of size n!), as noticed by M. Wachs and V. Reiner. See the Reiner, Saliola and Welker reference below. - _Nadia Lafreniere_, Jul 18 2019

a(n) is the number of distinct permutations for a Secret Santa gift exchange with n participants. - _Patrik Holopainen_, Dec 30 2019

a(2*n+1) is even. More generally, a(m*n+1) is divisible by m*n, which follows from a(n+1) = n*(a(n) + a(n-1)) = n*A000255(n-1) for n >= 1. a(2*n) is odd; in fact, a(2*n) == 1 (mod 8). Other divisibility properties include a(6*n) == 1 (mod 24), a(9*n+4) == a(9*n+7) == 0 (mod 9), a(10*n) == 1 (mod 40), a(11*n+5) == 0 (mod 11) and a(13*n+8 ) == 0 (mod 13). - _Peter Bala_, Apr 05 2022
