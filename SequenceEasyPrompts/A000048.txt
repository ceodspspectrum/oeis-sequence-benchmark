Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of n-bead necklaces with beads of 2 colors and primitive period n, when turning over is not allowed but the two colors can be interchanged.
Comments: Also, for any m which is a multiple of n, the number of 2m-bead balanced binary necklaces of fundamental period 2n that are equivalent to their complements. [Clarified by _Aaron Meyerowitz_, Jun 01 2024]

Also binary Lyndon words of length n with an odd number of 1's (for n>=1).

Also number of binary irreducible polynomials of degree n having trace 1.

Also number of binary irreducible polynomials of degree n having linear coefficient 1 (this is the same as the trace-1 condition, as the reciprocal of an irreducible polynomial is again irreducible).

Also number of binary irreducible self-reciprocal polynomials of degree 2*n; there is no such polynomial for odd degree except for x+1.

Also number of binary vectors (x_1,...x_n) satisfying Sum_{i=1..n} i*x_i = 1 (mod n+1) = size of Varshamov-Tenengolts code VT_1(n).

Also the number of dynamical cycles of period 2n of a threshold Boolean automata network which is a quasi-minimal negative circuit of size nq where q is odd and which is updated in parallel. - Mathilde Noual (mathilde.noual(AT)ens-lyon.fr), Mar 03 2009

Also the number of 3-elements orbits of the symmetric group S3 action on irreducible polynomials of degree 2n, n>1, over GF(2). - _Jean Francis Michon_, Philippe Ravache (philippe.ravache(AT)univ-rouen.fr), Oct 04 2009

Conjecture: Also the number of caliber-n cycles of Zagier-reduced indefinite binary quadratic forms with sum invariant equal to s, where (s-1)/n is an odd integer. - _Barry R. Smith_, Dec 14 2014

The Metropolis, Stein, Stein (1973) reference on page 31 Table II lists a(k) for k = 2 to 15 and is actually for sequence A056303 since there a(k) = 0 for k<2. - _Michael Somos_, Dec 20 2014
