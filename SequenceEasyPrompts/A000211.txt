Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) - 2, a(0) = 4, a(1) = 3.
Comments: Let I=I_n be the n X n identity matrix and P=P_n be the incidence matrix of the cycle (1,2,3,...,n). Then, for n>=3, a(n) is the number of (0,1) n X n matrices A<=P^(-1)+I+P with exactly two 1's in every row and column. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 11 2010
