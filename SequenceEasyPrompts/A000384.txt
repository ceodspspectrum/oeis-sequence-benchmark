Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Less well known is that for n>1, a(n) [0,1,6,15,28,...] is the first of 2n consecutive integers such that sum of the squares of the first n such integers is equal to the sum of the squares of the last n-1 plus n^2; e.g., 15^2 + 16^2 + 17^2 = 19^2 + 20^2 + 3^2. - _Charlie Marion_, Dec 16 2006

a(n) is the number of length 2n binary sequences that have exactly two 1's. a(2) = 6 because we have: {0,0,1,1}, {0,1,0,1}, {0,1,1,0}, {1,0,0,1}, {1,0,1,0}, {1,1,0,0}. The ordinary generating function with interpolated zeros is: (x^2 + 3*x^4)/(1-x^2)^3. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Jan 02 2014

For n > 0, a(n) is the largest integer k such that k^2 + n^2 is a multiple of k + n. More generally, for m > 0 and n > 0, the largest integer k such that k^(2*m) + n^(2*m) is a multiple of k + n is given by k = 2*n^(2*m) - n. - _Derek Orr_, Sep 04 2014

As Beedassy's formula shows, this Hexagonal number sequence is the odd bisection of the Triangle number sequence. Both of these sequences are figurative number sequences.  For A000384, a(n) can be found by multiplying its triangle number by its hexagonal number. For example let's use the number 153. 153 is said to be the 17th triangle number but is also said to be the 9th hexagonal number. Triangle(17) Hexagonal(9). 17*9=153. Because the Hexagonal number sequence is a subset of the Triangle number sequence, the Hexagonal number sequence will always have both a triangle number and a hexagonal number. n* (2*n-1) because (2*n-1) renders the triangle number. - _Bruce J. Nicholson_, Nov 05 2017

Also numbers k with the property that in the symmetric representation of sigma(k) the smallest Dyck path has a central valley and the largest Dyck path has a central peak, n >= 1. Thus all hexagonal numbers > 0 have middle divisors. (Cf. A237593.) - _Omar E. Pol_, Aug 28 2018

The n-th hexagonal number equals the sum of the n consecutive integers with the same parity starting at 2*n-1; for example, 1, 2+4, 3+5+7, 4+6+8+10, etc. In general, the n-th 2k-gonal number is the sum of the n consecutive integers with the same parity starting at (k-2)*n - (k-3). When k = 1 and 2, this result generates the positive integers, A000027, and the squares, A000290, respectively. - _Charlie Marion_, Mar 02 2022
