Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Euler (or secant or "Zig") numbers: e.g.f. (even powers only) sec(x) = 1/cos(x).
Comments: Inverse Gudermannian gd^(-1)(x) = log(sec(x) + tan(x)) = log(tan(Pi/4 + x/2)) = arctanh(sin(x)) = 2 * arctanh(tan(x/2)) = 2 * arctanh(csc(x) - cot(x)). - _Michael Somos_, Mar 19 2011

a(n) is the number of downup permutations of [2n]. Example: a(2)=5 counts 4231, 4132, 3241, 3142, 2143. - _David Callan_, Nov 21 2011

a(n) is the number of increasing full binary trees on vertices {0,1,2,...,2n} for which the leftmost leaf is labeled 2n. - _David Callan_, Nov 21 2011

a(n) is the number of unordered increasing trees of size 2n+1 with only even degrees allowed and degree-weight generating function given by cosh(t). - _Markus Kuba_, Sep 13 2014

a(n) is the number of standard Young tableaux of skew shape (n+1,n,n-1,...,3,2)/(n-1,n-2,...2,1). - _Ran Pan_, Apr 10 2015

Since cos(z) has a root at z = Pi/2 and no other root in C with a smaller |z|, the radius of convergence of the e.g.f. (intended complex-valued) is Pi/2 = A019669 (see also A028296). - _Stanislav Sykora_, Oct 07 2016

All terms are odd. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Jul 22 2018

The sequence starting with a(1) is periodic modulo any odd prime p. The minimal period is (p-1)/2 if p == 1 mod 4 and p-1 if p == 3 mod 4 [Knuth & Buckholtz, 1967, Theorem 2]. - _Allen Stenger_, Aug 03 2020

Conjecture: taking the sequence [a(n) : n >= 1] modulo an integer k gives a purely periodic sequence with period dividing phi(k). For example, the sequence taken modulo 21 begins [1, 5, 19, 20, 16, 2, 1, 5, 19, 20, 16, 2, 1, 5, 19, 20, 16, 2, 1, 5, 19, ...] with an apparent period of 6 = phi(21)/2. - _Peter Bala_, May 08 2023
