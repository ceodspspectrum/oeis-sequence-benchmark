Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Number of groups of order n.
Comments: Also, number of nonisomorphic subgroups of order n in symmetric group S_n. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Dec 16 2004

Also, number of nonisomorphic primitives of the combinatorial species Lin[n-1]. - _Nicolae Boicu_, Apr 29 2011

In (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008), a(n) is called the "group number of n", denoted by gnu(n), and the first occurrence of k is called the "minimal order attaining k", denoted by moa(k) (see A046057). - _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 15 2017

It is conjectured in (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008) that the sequence n -> a(n) -> a(a(n)) = a^2(n) -> a(a(a(n))) = a^3(n) -> ... -> consists ultimately of 1s, where a(n), denoted by gnu(n), is called the "group number of n". - _Muniru A Asiru_, Nov 19 2017

MacHale (2020) shows that there are infinitely many values of n for which there are more groups than rings of that order (cf. A027623). He gives n = 36355 as an example. It would be nice to have enough values of n to create an OEIS entry for them. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 02 2021

I conjecture that a(i) * a(j) <= a(i*j) for all nonnegative integers i and j. - _Jorge R. F. F. Lopes_, Apr 21 2024
