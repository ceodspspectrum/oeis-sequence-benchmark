Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Double factorial of even numbers: (2n)!! = 2^n*n!.
Comments: a(n) is also the size of the automorphism group of the graph (edge graph) of the n-dimensional hypercube and also of the geometric automorphism group of the hypercube (the two groups are isomorphic). This group is an extension of an elementary Abelian group (C_2)^n by S_n. (C_2 is the cyclic group with two elements and S_n is the symmetric group.) - Avi Peretz (njk(AT)netvision.net.il), Feb 21 2001

Then a(n) appears in the power series: sqrt(1+sin(y)) = Sum_{n>=0} (-1)^floor(n/2)*y^(n)/a(n) and sqrt((1+cos(y))/2) = Sum_{n>=0} (-1)^n*y^(2n)/a(2n). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Feb 02 2002

Appears to be the BinomialMean transform of A001907. See A075271. - _John W. Layman_, Sep 28 2002

Number of n X n monomial matrices with entries 0, +-1.

a(n) = A001044(n)/A000142(n)*A000079(n) = Product_{i=0..n-1} (2*i+2) = 2^n*Pochhammer(1,n). - Daniel Dockery (peritus(AT)gmail.com), Jun 13 2003

Also number of linear signed orders.

Define a "downgrade" to be the permutation d which places the items of a permutation p in descending order. This note concerns those permutations that are equal to their double-downgrades. The number of permutations of order 2n having this property are equinumerous with those of order 2n+1. a(n) = number of double-downgrading permutations of order 2n and 2n+1. - Eugene McDonnell (eemcd(AT)mac.com), Oct 27 2003

a(n) = (Integral_{x=0..Pi/2} cos(x)^(2*n+1) dx) where the denominators are b(n) = (2*n)!/(n!*2^n). - Al Hakanson (hawkuu(AT)excite.com), Mar 02 2004

1 + (1/2)x - (1/8)x^2 - (1/48)x^3 + (1/384)x^4 + ... = sqrt(1+sin(x)).

a(n)*(-1)^n = coefficient of the leading term of the (n+1)-th derivative of arctan(x), see Hildebrand link. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jan 14 2006

a(n) is the Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric 2n X 2n matrix whose (i,j) entry is j for i<j. - _David Callan_, Sep 25 2006

a(n) is the number of increasing plane trees with n+1 edges. (In a plane tree, each subtree of the root is an ordered tree but the subtrees of the root may be cyclically rotated.) Increasing means the vertices are labeled 0,1,2,...,n+1 and each child has a greater label than its parent. Cf. A001147 for increasing ordered trees, A000142 for increasing unordered trees and A000111 for increasing 0-1-2 trees. - _David Callan_, Dec 22 2006

Hamed Hatami and Pooya Hatami prove that this is an upper bound on the cardinality of any minimal dominating set in C_{2n+1}^n, the Cartesian product of n copies of the cycle of size 2n+1, where 2n+1 is a prime. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jan 03 2007

This sequence and (1,-2,0,0,0,0,...) form a reciprocal pair under the list partition transform and associated operations described in A133314. - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 29 2007

a(n) = number of permutations of the multiset {1,1,2,2,...,n,n,n+1,n+1} such that between the two occurrences of i, there is exactly one entry >i, for i=1,2,...,n. Example: a(2) = 8 counts 121323, 131232, 213123, 231213, 232131, 312132, 321312, 323121. Proof: There is always exactly one entry between the two 1s (when n>=1). Given a permutation p in A(n) (counted by a(n)), record the position i of the first 1, then delete both 1s and subtract 1 from every entry to get a permutation q in A(n-1). The mapping p -> (i,q) is a bijection from A(n) to the Cartesian product [1,2n] X A(n-1). - _David Callan_, Nov 29 2007

Row sums of A028338. - _Paul Barry_, Feb 07 2009

a(n) is the number of ways to seat n married couples in a row so that everyone is next to their spouse. Compare A007060. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Mar 29 2009

From _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 21 2009: (Start)

Equals (-1)^n * (1, 1, 2, 8, 48, ...) dot (1, -3, 5, -7, 9, ...).

Example: a(4) = 384 = (1, 1, 2, 8, 48) dot (1, -3, 5, -7, 9) = (1, -3, 10, -56, 432). (End)

exp(x/2) = Sum_{n>=0} x^n/a(n). - _Jaume Oliver Lafont_, Sep 07 2009

Assuming n starts at 0, a(n) appears to be the number of Gray codes on n bits. It certainly is the number of Gray codes on n bits isomorphic to the canonical one. Proof: There are 2^n different starting positions for each code. Also, each code has a particular pattern of bit positions that are flipped (for instance, 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 for n=3), and these bit position patterns can be permuted in n! ways. - D. J. Schreffler (ds1404(AT)txstate.edu), Jul 18 2010

E.g.f. of 0,1,2,8,... is x/(1-2x/(2-2x/(3-8x/(4-8x/(5-18x/(6-18x/(7-... (continued fraction). - _Paul Barry_, Jan 17 2011

Number of increasing 2-colored trees with choice of two colors for each edge. In general, if we replace 2 with k we get the number of increasing k-colored trees. For example, for k=3 we get the triple factorial numbers. - _Wenjin Woan_, May 31 2011

a(n) = row sums of triangle A193229. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jul 18 2011

Also the number of permutations of 2n (or of 2n+1) that are equal to their reverse-complements. (See the Egge reference.) Note that the double-downgrade described in the preceding comment (McDonnell) is equivalent to the reverse-complement. - _Justin M. Troyka_, Aug 11 2011

The e.g.f. can be used to form a generator, [1/(1-2x)] d/dx, for A000108, so a(n) can be applied to A145271 to generate the Catalan numbers. - _Tom Copeland_, Oct 01 2011

The e.g.f. of 1/a(n) is BesselI(0,sqrt(2*x)). See Abramowitz-Stegun (reference and link under A008277), p. 375, 9.6.10. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 09 2012

Row sums of triangle A208057. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Feb 22 2012

a(n) is the number of ways to designate a subset of elements in each n-permutation. a(n) = A000142(n) + A001563(n) + A001804(n) + A001805(n) + A001806(n) + A001807(n) + A035038(n) * n!. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Nov 08 2012

a(n) is the order of the group O_n(Z) = {A in M_n(Z): A*A^T = I_n}, the group of n X n orthogonal matrices over the integers. - _Jianing Song_, Mar 29 2021

a(n) is the number of ways to tile a (3n,3n)-benzel or a (3n+1,3n+2)-benzel using left stones and two kinds of bones; see Defant et al., below. - _James Propp_, Jul 22 2023
