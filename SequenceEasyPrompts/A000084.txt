Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of series-parallel networks with n unlabeled edges. Also called yoke-chains by Cayley and MacMahon.
Comments: This is a series-parallel network: o-o; all other series-parallel networks are obtained by connecting two series-parallel networks in series or in parallel.

Also the number of unlabeled cographs on n nodes. - _N. J. A. Sloane_ and _Eric W. Weisstein_, Oct 21 2003

Also the number of P_4-free graphs on n nodes. - _Gordon F. Royle_, Jul 04 2008

Equals row sums of triangle A144962 and the INVERT transform of A001572. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 27 2008

See Cameron (1987) p. 165 for a bijection between series-parallel networks and cographs. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 19 2014
