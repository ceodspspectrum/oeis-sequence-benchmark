Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of ways of writing n as a sum of 5 squares.
Comments: The units digit of a(n) is 2 if n=5*t^2 for some natural number t, and 0 otherwise. See Moreno & Wagstaff, p. 258, exercise 2. - _Ant King_, Mar 17 2013

See A025429 for the number of partitions of n into five nonzero squares. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 30 2014

Also, theta series of lattice Z^5. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jul 27 2020
