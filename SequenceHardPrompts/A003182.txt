Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Dedekind numbers: inequivalent monotone Boolean functions of n or fewer variables, or antichains of subsets of an n-set.
Comments: NP-equivalence classes of unate Boolean functions of n or fewer variables.

Also the number of simple games with n players in minimal winning form up to isomorphism. - _Fabi√°n Riquelme_, Mar 13 2018

The labeled case is A000372. - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 23 2019

First differs from A348260(n + 1) at a(5) = 210, A348260(6) = 233. - _Gus Wiseman_, Nov 28 2021

Pawelski & Szepietowski show that a(n) = A001206(n) (mod 2) and that a(9) = 6 (mod 210). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 16 2023
