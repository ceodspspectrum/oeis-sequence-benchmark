Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Maximal number of edges in a graceful graph on n nodes.
Comments: A graph with e edges is "graceful" if its nodes can be labeled with distinct integers in {0,1,...,e} so that, if each edge is labeled with the absolute difference between the labels of its endpoints, then the e edges have the distinct labels 1, 2, ..., e.

Equivalently, maximum m for which there's a restricted difference basis with respect to m with n elements. A "difference basis w.r.t. m" is a set of integers such that every integer from 1 to m is a difference between two elements of the set. A "restricted" difference basis is one in which the smallest element is 0 and the largest is m.

a(n) is also the length of an optimal ruler with n marks. For definitions see A103294. For example, a(6)=13 is the length of the optimal rulers with 6 marks, {[0, 1, 6, 9, 11, 13], [0, 2, 4, 7, 12, 13], [0, 1, 4, 5, 11, 13], [0, 2, 8, 9, 12, 13], [0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 13], [0, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13]}. Also n = 1 + A103298(a(n)). - _Peter Luschny_, Feb 28 2005

If the conjecture is true that an optimal ruler with more than 12 segments is a Wichmann ruler then the sequence continues 232, 251, 270, 289, 308, 327, ... - _Peter Luschny_, Oct 09 2011 [updated to take the verifications of Robison into account, Oct 01 2015]
