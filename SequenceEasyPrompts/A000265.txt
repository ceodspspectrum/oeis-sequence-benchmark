Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Remove all factors of 2 from n; or largest odd divisor of n; or odd part of n.
Comments: When n > 0 is written as k*2^j with k odd then k = A000265(n) and j = A007814(n), so: when n is written as k*2^j - 1 with k odd then k = A000265(n+1) and j = A007814(n+1), when n > 1 is written as k*2^j + 1 with k odd then k = A000265(n-1) and j = A007814(n-1).

Also denominator of 2^n/n (numerator is A075101(n)). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Sep 01 2002

Slope of line connecting (o, a(o)) where o = (2^k)(n-1) + 1 is 2^k and (by design) starts at (1, 1). - Josh Locker (joshlocker(AT)macfora.com), Apr 17 2004

Numerator of n/2^(n-1). - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Feb 11 2005

"The sequence can be arranged in a table:

                          1

                       1  3  1

                    1  5  3  7  1

              1  9  5 11  3 13  7 15  1

  1 17  9 19  5 21 11 23  3 25 13 27  7 29 15 31  1

Every new row is the previous row interspaced with the continuation of the odd numbers.

Except for the ones; the terms (t) in each column are t+t+/-s = t_+1. Starting from the center column of threes and working to the left the values of s are given by A000265 and working to the right by A000265." (End)

This is a fractal sequence. The odd-numbered elements give the odd natural numbers. If these elements are removed, the original sequence is recovered. - _Kerry Mitchell_, Dec 07 2005

2k + 1 is the k-th and largest of the subsequence of k terms separating two successive equal entries in a(n). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Dec 30 2005

It's not difficult to show that the sum of the first 2^n terms is (4^n + 2)/3. - _Nick Hobson_, Jan 14 2005

In the table, for each row, (sum of terms between 3 and 1) - (sum of terms between 1 and 3) = A020988. - _Eric Desbiaux_, May 27 2009

This sequence appears in the analysis of A160469 and A156769, which resemble the  numerator and denominator of the Taylor series for tan(x). - _Johannes W. Meijer_, May 24 2009

Indices n such that a(n) divides 2^n - 1 are listed in A068563. - _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 25 2013

From _Alexander R. Povolotsky_, Dec 17 2014: (Start)

With regard to the tabular presentation described in the comment by Marco Matosic: in his drawing, starting with the 3rd row, the first term in the row, which is equal to 1 (or, alternatively the last term in the row, which is also equal to 1), is not in the actual sequence and is added to the drawing as a fictitious term (for the sake of symmetry); an actual A000265(n) could be considered to be a(j,k) (where j >= 1 is the row number and k>=1 is the column subscript), such that a(j,1) = 1:

  1

  1  3

  1  5  3  7

  1  9  5 11  3 13  7 15

  1 17  9 19  5 21 11 23  3 25 13 27  7 29 15 31

and so on ... .

The relationship between k and j for each row is 1 <= k <= 2^(j-1). In this corrected tabular representation, Marco's notion that "every new row is the previous row interspaced with the continuation of the odd numbers" remains true. (End)

Partitions natural numbers to the same equivalence classes as A064989. That is, for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) <=> A064989(i) = A064989(j). There are dozens of other such sequences (like A003602) for which this also holds: In general, all sequences for which a(2n) = a(n) and the odd bisection is injective. - _Antti Karttunen_, Apr 15 2017

This sequence is the truncated triangle:

   1,  1;

   3,  1,  5;

   3,  7,  1,  9;

   5, 11,  3, 13,  7;

  15,  1, 17,  9, 19,  5;

  21, 11, 23,  3, 25, 13, 27;

   7, 29, 15, 31,  1, 33, 17, 35;

  ...

The first column is A069834. The second column is A213671. The main diagonal is A236999. The first upper diagonal is A125650 without 0.

c(n) = ((n*(n+1)/2))/A069834 = 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, ... for n > 0. n*(n+1)/2 is the rank of A069834. (End)

As well as being multiplicative, a(n) is a strong divisibility sequence, that is, gcd(a(n),a(m)) = a(gcd(n,m)) for n, m >= 1. In particular, a(n) is a divisibility sequence: if n divides m then a(n) divides a(m). - _Peter Bala_, Feb 27 2019

a(n) is also the map n -> A026741(n) applied at least A007814(n) times. - _Federico Provvedi_, Dec 14 2021
