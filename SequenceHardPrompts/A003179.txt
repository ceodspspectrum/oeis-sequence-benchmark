Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Number of self-dual binary codes of length 2n (up to column permutation equivalence).
Comments: The length 36 binary self dual codes have been classified. - _Nathan J. Russell_, Feb 14 2016

This is number of binary self-dual codes of length 2n up to column permutation equivalence. Sequence A028362 gives an actual count of all possible binary self-dual codes of length 2n. - _Nathan J. Russell_, Nov 25 2018
