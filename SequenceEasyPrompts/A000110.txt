Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:

Name: Bell or exponential numbers: number of ways to partition a set of n labeled elements.
Comments: The leading diagonal of its difference table is the sequence shifted, see Bernstein and Sloane (1995). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 04 2015

Also the number of equivalence relations that can be defined on a set of n elements. - Federico Arboleda (federico.arboleda(AT)gmail.com), Mar 09 2005

a(n) = number of nonisomorphic colorings of a map consisting of a row of n+1 adjacent regions. Adjacent regions cannot have the same color. - _David W. Wilson_, Feb 22 2005

If an integer is squarefree and has n distinct prime factors then a(n) is the number of ways of writing it as a product of its divisors. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Apr 23 2001

Consider rooted trees of height at most 2. Letting each tree 'grow' into the next generation of n means we produce a new tree for every node which is either the root or at height 1, which gives the Bell numbers. - _Jon Perry_, Jul 23 2003

Begin with [1,1] and follow the rule that [1,k] -> [1,k+1] and [1,k] k times, e.g., [1,3] is transformed to [1,4], [1,3], [1,3], [1,3]. Then a(n) is the sum of all components: [1,1] = 2; [1,2], [1,1] = 5; [1,3], [1,2], [1,2], [1,2], [1,1] = 15; etc. - _Jon Perry_, Mar 05 2004

Number of distinct rhyme schemes for a poem of n lines: a rhyme scheme is a string of letters (e.g., 'abba') such that the leftmost letter is always 'a' and no letter may be greater than one more than the greatest letter to its left. Thus 'aac' is not valid since 'c' is more than one greater than 'a'. For example, a(3)=5 because there are 5 rhyme schemes: aaa, aab, aba, abb, abc; also see example by Neven Juric. - _Bill Blewett_, Mar 23 2004

In other words, number of length-n restricted growth strings (RGS) [s(0),s(1),...,s(n-1)] where s(0)=0 and s(k) <= 1 + max(prefix) for k >= 1, see example (cf. A080337 and A189845). - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 30 2011

Number of partitions of {1, ..., n+1} into subsets of nonconsecutive integers, including the partition 1|2|...|n+1. E.g., a(3)=5: there are 5 partitions of {1,2,3,4} into subsets of nonconsecutive integers, namely, 13|24, 13|2|4, 14|2|3, 1|24|3, 1|2|3|4. - _Augustine O. Munagi_, Mar 20 2005

a(n+1) is the number of binary relations on an n-element set that are both symmetric and transitive. - Justin Witt (justinmwitt(AT)gmail.com), Jul 12 2005

If the rule from Jon Perry, Mar 05 2004, is used, then a(n-1) = [number of components used to form a(n)] / 2. - Daniel Kuan (dkcm(AT)yahoo.com), Feb 19 2006

a(n) is the number of functions f from {1,...,n} to {1,...,n,n+1} that satisfy the following two conditions for all x in the domain: (1) f(x) > x; (2) f(x)=n+1 or f(f(x))=n+1. E.g., a(3)=5 because there are exactly five functions that satisfy the two conditions: f1={(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)}, f2={(1,4),(2,3),(3,4)}, f3={(1,3),(2,4),(3,4)}, f4={(1,2),(2,4),(3,4)} and f5={(1,3),(2,3),(3,4)}. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Feb 20 2006

Number of asynchronic siteswap patterns of length n which have no zero-throws (i.e., contain no 0's) and whose number of orbits (in the sense given by Allen Knutson) is equal to the number of balls. E.g., for n=4, the condition is satisfied by the following 15 siteswaps: 4444, 4413, 4242, 4134, 4112, 3441, 2424, 1344, 2411, 1313, 1241, 2222, 3131, 1124, 1111. Also number of ways to choose n permutations from identity and cyclic permutations (1 2), (1 2 3), ..., (1 2 3 ... n) so that their composition is identity. For n=3 we get the following five: id o id o id, id o (1 2) o (1 2), (1 2) o id o (1 2), (1 2) o (1 2) o id, (1 2 3) o (1 2 3) o (1 2 3). (To see the bijection, look at Ehrenborg and Readdy paper.) - _Antti Karttunen_, May 01 2006

a(n) is the number of permutations on [n] in which a 3-2-1 (scattered) pattern occurs only as part of a 3-2-4-1 pattern. Example: a(3) = 5 counts all permutations on [3] except 321. See "Eigensequence for Composition" reference a(n) = number of permutation tableaux of size n (A000142) whose first row contains no 0's. Example: a(3)=5 counts {{}, {}, {}}, {{1}, {}}, {{1}, {0}}, {{1}, {1}}, {{1, 1}}. - _David Callan_, Oct 07 2006

The terms can also be computed with finite steps and precise integer arithmetic. Instead of exp(P)/exp(1) one can compute A = exp(P - I) where I is the identity-matrix of appropriate dimension since (P-I) is nilpotent to the order of its dimension. Then a(n)=A[n,1] where n is the row-index starting at 1. - _Gottfried Helms_, Apr 10 2007

When n is prime, a(n) == 2 (mod n), but the converse is not always true. Define a Bell pseudoprime to be a composite number n such that a(n) == 2 (mod n). W. F. Lunnon recently found the Bell pseudoprimes 21361 = 41*521 and C46 = 3*23*16218646893090134590535390526854205539989357 and conjectured that Bell pseudoprimes are extremely scarce. So the second Bell pseudoprime is unlikely to be known with certainty in the near future. I confirmed that 21361 is the first. - _David W. Wilson_, Aug 04 2007 and Sep 24 2007

a(n) is also the number of idempotent order-decreasing full transformations (of an n-chain).

a(n+1) is also the number of partial one-one order-decreasing transformations (of an n-chain). (End)

From _Peter Bala_, Oct 19 2008: (Start)

Bell(n) is the number of n-pattern sequences [Cooper & Kennedy]. An n-pattern sequence is a sequence of integers (a_1,...,a_n) such that a_i = i or a_i = a_j for some j < i. For example, Bell(3) = 5 since the 3-pattern sequences are (1,1,1), (1,1,3), (1,2,1), (1,2,2) and (1,2,3).

Bell(n) is the number of sequences of positive integers (N_1,...,N_n) of length n such that N_1 = 1 and N_(i+1) <= 1 + max{j = 1..i} N_j for i >= 1 (see the comment by B. Blewett above). It is interesting to note that if we strengthen the latter condition to N_(i+1) <= 1 + N_i we get the Catalan numbers A000108 instead of the Bell numbers.

Repeated iterates of (binomial transform of [1,0,0,0,...]) will converge upon (1, 2, 5, 15, 52, ...) when each result is prefaced with a "1"; such that the final result is the fixed limit: (binomial transform of [1,1,2,5,15,...]) = (1,2,5,15,52,...). - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jan 14 2009

From _Karol A. Penson_, May 03 2009: (Start)

Relation between the Bell numbers B(n) and the n-th derivative of 1/Gamma(1+x) evaluated at x=1:

a) produce a number of such derivatives through seq(subs(x=1, simplify((d^n/dx^n)GAMMA(1+x)^(-1))), n=1..5);

b) leave them expressed in terms of digamma (Psi(k)) and polygamma (Psi(k,n)) functions and unevaluated;

Examples of such expressions, for n=1..5, are:

n=1: -Psi(1),

n=2: -(-Psi(1)^2 + Psi(1,1)),

n=3: -Psi(1)^3 + 3*Psi(1)*Psi(1,1) - Psi(2,1),

n=4: -(-Psi(1)^4 + 6*Psi(1)^2*Psi(1,1) - 3*Psi(1,1)^2 - 4*Psi(1)*Psi(2,1) + Psi(3, 1)),

n=5: -Psi(1)^5 + 10*Psi(1)^3*Psi(1,1) - 15*Psi(1)*Psi(1,1)^2 - 10*Psi(1)^2*Psi(2,1) + 10*Psi(1,1)*Psi(2,1) + 5*Psi(1)*Psi(3,1) - Psi(4,1);

c) for a given n, read off the sum of absolute values of coefficients of every term involving digamma or polygamma functions.

This sum is equal to B(n). Examples: B(1)=1, B(2)=1+1=2, B(3)=1+3+1=5, B(4)=1+6+3+4+1=15, B(5)=1+10+15+10+10+5+1=52;

d) Observe that this decomposition of the Bell number B(n) apparently does not involve the Stirling numbers of the second kind explicitly.

We discovered that g(x=1,m) = (-1)^m * (A040027(m) - A000110(m+1) * A073003).

The Bell numbers serve as the upper limit for the number of distinct homomorphic images from any given finite universal algebra. Every algebra homomorphism is determined by its kernel, which must be a congruence relation. As the number of possible congruence relations with respect to a finite universal algebra must be a subset of its possible equivalence classes (given by the Bell numbers), it follows naturally. - _Max Sills_, Jun 01 2010

A binary counter with faulty bits starts at value 0 and attempts to increment by 1 at each step.

a(n+1) is the number of (symmetric) positive semidefinite n X n 0-1 matrices. These correspond to equivalence relations on {1,...,n+1}, where matrix element M[i,j] = 1 if and only if i and j are equivalent to each other but not to n+1. - _Robert Israel_, Mar 16 2011

B(n) counts the length n+1 rhyme schemes without repetitions. E.g., for n=2 there are 5 rhyme schemes of length 3 (aaa, aab, aba, abb, abc), and the 2 without repetitions are aba, abc.

In fact it is not really an eigensequence of the Pascal matrix; rather the Pascal matrix acts on the sequence as a shift. It is an eigensequence (the unique eigensequence with eigenvalue 1) of the matrix derived from the Pascal matrix by adding at the top the row [1, 0, 0, 0 ...]. The binomial sum formula may be derived from the definition in terms of partitions: label any element X of a set S of N elements, and let X(k) be the number of subsets of S containing X with k elements. Since each subset has a unique coset, the number of partitions p(N) of S is given by p(N) = Sum_{k=1..N} (X(k) p(N-k)); trivially X(k) = N-1 choose k-1. - _Mason Bogue_, Mar 20 2015

a(n) = Sum(# of standard immaculate tableaux of shape m, m is a composition of n), where this sum is over all integer compositions m of n > 0. This formula is easily seen to hold by identifying standard immaculate tableaux of size n with set partitions of { 1, 2, ..., n }. For example, if we sum over integer compositions of 4 lexicographically, we see that 1+1+2+1+3+3+3+1 = 15 = A000110(4). - _John M. Campbell_, Jul 17 2017
