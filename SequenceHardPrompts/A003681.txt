Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: a(n) = min { p +- q : p +- q > 1 and p*q = Product_{k=1..n-1} a(k) }.
Comments: a(n) = A082120(Product_{k=1..n-1} a(k)) for n >= 3. - _Robert Israel_, Aug 12 2015

The + sign in the definition applies only for n = 1 and n = 2, thereafter only the - sign is relevant and will yield the minimum. The definition could be reformulated in a way similar to that of A056737. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 17 2015
