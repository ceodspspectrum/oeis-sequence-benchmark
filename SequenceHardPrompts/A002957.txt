Write a python code that takes a number n as input from stdin, outputs a single element of a sequence as a string to stdout. Just output the n-th element in the sequence, not the whole sequence or anything other than the single sequence element. You will be graded by my running your code and comparing the results with a look-up table. If you use a look-up table for your code, you will not only fail the test. Hardcoding values that can be computed without hardcoding is considered to be using a look-up table. Use only the standard python library. No packages will be installed with pip or conda. Output your final code at the end of your response inside triple backticks like:
```
#your code goes here
```
The last part of your response that is inside triple backticks will be used as your response for the purposes of the test. The code will be stopped after a short period of time, so make it efficient if needed.

Here is some information on the sequence:
```
Name: Numbers k such that 2*10^k - 1 is prime.
Comments: Also numbers k such that 10^k + 9*R_k is prime, where R_k = 11...1 is the repunit (A002275) of length k.

Serge Batalov discovered that 1059002 belongs to this sequence but may not be the next term. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 30 2013

a(28) > 410000 (from Kamada data). - _Robert Price_, Oct 19 2014

Rytis Slatkevičius proved there are no undiscovered terms up to 1059002, so that term has now been added as a(28). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Jan 17 2023
